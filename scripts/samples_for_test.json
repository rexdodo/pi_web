    "context": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Four militants armed with guns and grenades stormed a mosque in Rawalpindi frequented by military personnel, killing dozens of people Friday -- most of them children, the military said.\n\nThe attack is the latest to shake the garrison city since this year's launch of strong military offensives against Taliban insurgents in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan. Rawalpindi is the headquarters of the Pakistani army.\n\nMaj. Gen. Athar Abbas said Friday's assault killed 36 people and wounded 75.\n\nAmong the dead were 17 children, according to the military's Web site. Also killed were an army general and eight other military officials, six of them of senior rank. The remaining fatalities were adults.\n\n\"As soon as the mosque's security staff checked me, there was a blast and then a finger hit me, then there was another,\" Ishtiaq, a driver for a military officer, told GEO TV.\n\nIshtiaq, who uses only one name, was attending midday prayers.\n\nRawalpindi is near Islamabad, and the mosque is near national army headquarters. It is located inside a walled residential compound where many military families have homes.\n\nA witness told GEO TV there were up to 300 worshippers at the mosque at the time of the attack.\n\nThe militants hurled grenades before opening fire, Rawalpindi Police Chief Aslam Tareen told CNN. He said all the militants died, but he doesn't know how.\n\n\"These are not militants,\" Abbas said. \"These are terrorists who killed innocent worshippers.\"\n\nRetired Gen. Muhammad Yousaf was killed in the attack, said Col. Baseer Haider, a military spokesman. He said Yousaf was a former vice chief of army staff who was second in command during the administration of President Pervez Musharraf.\n\nAbbas said two of the attackers were suicide bombers who blew themselves up inside the Parade Lane mosque; the other two were shot and killed by security forces outside the mosque.\n\nSeveral explosions were heard inside the mosque around 1:30 p.m. (3:30 a.m. ET), followed by gunfire, Abbas said. The militants entered the compound by climbing over a wall, Tareen said.\n\nThis is the first attack in Rawalpindi since a suicide bomber targeted a bank on November 2.\n\nOn October 10, militants stormed army headquarters in Rawalpindi, taking several people hostage before security forces killed them.\n\nCNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.",

    "context": "(CNN) -- Farrah Fawcett, the actress known worldwide for her beauty and her role on \"Charlie's Angels,\" is reportedly seriously ill and may be close to death after a long battle with cancer.\n\nFarrah Fawcett, seen here in 2004, is featured in a documentary about her fight with cancer.\n\nA documentary, which airs Friday night on NBC, will feature an intimate look at her life since being diagnosed with the disease.\n\nOn Thursday, Larry King talked with Candy Spelling, a close friend of Fawcett. Her husband, the late Aaron Spelling, produced \"Charlie's Angels.\" Spelling talks about her relationship with Fawcett and why she believes she did the documentary.\n\nThe following is an edited version of the interview.\n\nLarry King: Did you first meet Farrah in connection with getting that part?\n\nCandy Spelling: Yes. Actually, she did a lot of small, little parts in the movies for Aaron starting around 1973. So it's been, my God, 36, 37 years since I, you know, first met her.  Watch Candy Spelling talk about her friendship with Farrah Fawcett »\n\nKing: So you knew her well during all that time?\n\nSpelling: Yes.\n\nKing: Did you know about her getting picked to be on \"Charlie's Angels?\"\n\nSpelling: I remember. She did some small roles. I think the one that Aaron really decided he was really going to use her was this American beauty pageant and, also, it was like \"Murder on Flight 502.\" He did the 90-minute versions.\n\nKing: Movie of the week?\n\nSpelling: Right. Movie of the weeks.\n\nKing: When did you know she had cancer?\n\nSpelling: I found out about a year -- when I first heard, I don't know if it was a year or two years ago when we first heard, and I contacted her. I hadn't talked to her in a while. She said, \"I'm going to be all right, Candy. Everything is going to be all right.\"\n\nKing: Why do you think, Candy, she did the documentary?\n\nSpelling: I think that she wanted to give other people courage that, you know, are fighting this kind of thing. I know how, you know, devastating the press, you know, was with Aaron when he had cancer. And it's just so difficult. And I mean, you know, it's hard to have a private life at that point.\n\nKing: Why do the tabloids get so tough on someone in such pain?\n\nSpelling: It's news. It's kind of a sad thing. I'm always so sorry to see it. But, you know, people believe what they see, and a lot of times, we don't know how true it really is.",

She said she wouldn't call it a formal investigation.\n\nThe Chinese women's gymnastics team won a gold medal in a team competition at the Summer Olympics Games. Five members won medals in individual competitions.\n\nYet commentators, bloggers and others have raised questions about whether about half the members of China's team were old enough to compete -- athletes must be at least 16 in the year the games take place.\n\nIn women's gymnastics, younger teenage girls can have an advantage over older competitors due to their often smaller, more agile bodies and lighter frames.\n\n\"We have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number questions and apparent discrepancies on this case,\" Davis said.\n\nA top Chinese Olympic official said questions regarding the ages of the athletes have been dealt with previously.\n\n\"The eligibility of the athletes has already been investigated and authorized by the international federation and, if they hadn't been cleared, they wouldn't have participated in the games,\" said Wang Wei, executive vice president of the Beijing Olympic Committee.\n\nChinese officials provided the Olympic committee with passports, showing that team members were of legal age, but numerous challenges have been made.\n\nThe latest came from a blogger known as \"Stryde Hax.\" The blogger claims to have uncovered proof that Chinese gymnast He Kexin is only 14.  Watch bloggers question China's gymnasts »\n\nIn Internet searches, \"Stryde Hax\" allegedly uncovered Web pages showing lists complied by China's General Administration of Sport that show a 1994 date of birth for He. That would make her 14 -- too young to compete in the Olympic Games.\n\nCNN has not been able to independently verify the information, but snapshots of the Web pages appear to back up the claim. Other bloggers have joined the search and reported similar results.\n\nThe New York Times conducted its own investigation, producing similar results that seem to implicate He and two other members of the team. The Times uncovered a 2006 biography on He that lists her birthday as January 1, 1994.\n\n\"According to online sports registration lists in China, half the team - He Kexin, Yang Yilin, Jiang Yuyuan - would be under age,\" the Times reported in July.\n\nThe International Gymnastics Federation, however, has said that those gymnasts were eligible and that the ages on their passports were correct.\n\nChinese gymnastics coaches defended their team Friday.\n\n\"Our athletes participating in these games all conform to the age regulations of the Olympics,\" said Huang Yubin, head coach of the men's and women's teams.\n\n\"Asians have different figures than people from the West, so that's what caused their suspicion,\" Huang said, referring to media inquiries. \"They shouldn't be suspicious.\"\n\nCNN's John Vause contributed to this story",

Watch more about the campaign against Schall »\n\nSchall told CNN he had never before been subjected to such a level of racial hatred.\n\n\"I am shocked,\" he said Thursday at a campaign event in Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia. \"I simply cannot believe that people would do this to fellow humans.\"\n\nSchall, who appears on a CDU election poster, said he is scared.\n\n\"I have police patrolling at my house day and night, and some officers stay in my house overnight,\" he said.\n\nBut Schall said he is not thinking of leaving Germany and the CDU said he has the party's full support. Schall and the CDU said they have filed a lawsuit against the NPD.\n\nThe situation escalated Wednesday when the NPD's national leadership held a rally in Schall's adopted hometown of Hildburghausen. Party Chairman Udo Voigt tried to speak with Schall \"and persuade Mr. Schall that he is needed more in Angola than in Germany,\" the NPD said in a news release.\n\nPolice sent to protect Schall stopped the NPD's representatives from accessing Schall's premises.\n\nHe is campaigning for the CDU for a state election in Thuringia, which is in the former communist East Germany. Right-wing extremism is generally a bigger problem in eastern Germany than in the west of the country, and citizens of Hildburghausen told CNN that, though most people support the politician, fascism is a problem in the area.\n\n\"Of course we have a base of right-wingers here,\" a passer-by said at the market in the town's center.\n\nBut most of those questioned by CNN denounced the campaign against Schall and said he is a respected member of the community.\n\n\"I am not only a member of the CDU, I am also a voluntary firefighter at the local department,\" Schall said.\n\nFrank Schwerdt, the NPD's leader in Erfurt, tried to downplay the events.\n\n\"This is not a personal campaign against Mr. Schall,\" Schwerdt said. \"We simply feel that many citizens don't want foreigners to have a say in our politics.\"\n\nThe NPD has been under surveillance by Germany's Office for the Protection of the Constitution for alleged contacts with illegal neo-Nazi groups. However, past efforts to ban the party have failed on technical grounds.\n\nThe NPD denies ties to illegal groups.\n\nBut members of the Christian Democratic Union told CNN that, since the racist campaign started against Schall, he has received several death threats and the party will no longer allow him to do media interviews because of the risks.\n\nAt Thursday's campaign event in central Erfurt, increased police presence was noticeable and CDU members said plainclothes officers had been dispatched among the crowd.",

He is in Italian custody and is awaiting extradition to Rwanda.\n\nAccording to Interpol's statement, the Rwandan arrest warrant says Uwayezu was alleged \"to have acted individually and as part of a conspiracy to plan and commit genocide by instigating Hutus to kill Tutsis in the area of Gikongoro, as director of the Groupe Scolaire Marie Merci college in Kibeho.\"\n\nHe is accused of \"participating in meetings with government and military authorities which allegedly planned the extermination of the Tutsi ethnic group\" and \"complicity in the massacre of some 80 students in May 1994 in the college which he headed.\"\n\nUwayezu arrived in Italy in 1997, took an alias, and was working as a vicar at the Church in Empoli commune near Florence when he was seized, Interpol said.\n\nThe man was identified after Interpol's fugitives unit received information and pictures from Rwandan authorities.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Florence issued a statement about the arrest two days ago, saying it hopes the justice system will come up with the truth about the case.\n\nBut, it said, \"we stand by the fact that Don Emmanuel has always declared his estrangement to the events in question and we accompany him in prayers.\"\n\nOne Italian news report noted that Uwayezu is a priest of Hutu ethnicity and lived and worked as vice-parish priest in Ponzano, part of the county of Empoli.\n\nDon Guido Engels, the head of the parish and a priest, told the ASCA news agency that \"Don Emmanuel never cultivated feelings towards another ethnic group. He always wanted peace.\"\n\n\"The arrest of Uwayezu demonstrates the power and effectiveness of international co-operation between police worldwide in obtaining information in relation to the identification, location and apprehension of fugitives around the world,\" said Jean-Michel Louboutin, Interpol's executive director of police services.\n\n\"This operation is a credit to law enforcement officers and agencies in Italy and Rwanda.\"\n\nTwo years ago, Interpol created a unit dedicated to searching for fugitives in the genocide who were wanted by Rwanda and the U.N.-sponsored International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. So far, seven people wanted by Rwanda and five wanted by the tribunal have been arrested.\n\nPolice in Uganda recently arrested and extradited a man who is among the most wanted suspects from the Rwandan genocide. Idelphonse Nizeyimana was picked up at a hotel in Rubaga, a suburb of the capital, Kampala.\n\nThe arrest, by Ugandan police, was part of an operation between the tribunal, Ugandan authorities, and Interpol. Nizeyimana was transferred Tuesday to a U.N. detention facility in Arusha, Tanzania, where the tribunal is based.\n\nThe 1994 Rwandan genocide left an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus dead over a 100-day period, the United Nations and Interpol say. Millions more were raped and disfigured, and nearly an entire generation of children lost their parents.",

The JSF engine program -- already delayed and over budget -- could end up costing taxpayers billions of dollars, according to Gates.\n\nBut with jobs at stake, Congress has ignored those requests for years and continued to appropriate funds for the C-17 and a second F-35 engine.\n\n\"The detailed conditions they [Congress] have imposed on the overall JSF program would make it essentially un-executable and impose unacceptable schedule and budget costs,\" Gates said Thursday at a Pentagon briefing.\n\n\"As I have stated repeatedly, should the Congress insist on adding funding for a costly and unnecessary JSF extra engine or direct changes that seriously disrupt the JSF program, or impose additional C-17 aircraft, I will strongly recommend that the president veto such legislation,\" he said.\n\nThe Pentagon believes the proposal for the new engine, made by General Electric, would end up costing about $2.9 billion which includes re-working the engine already being tested because there is concern it does not meet the performance needs for the F-35. Those costs would be picked up by taxpayer dollars, according to Pentagon estimates.\n\nAdditionally the contract for the new proposal by Congress would require cutting the purchase of the current engine by half to let the General Electric engine purchase catch up, according to Gates.\n\n\"Only in Washington does a proposal where everybody wins get considered a competition, where everybody is guaranteed a piece of the action at the end,\" Gates said.\n\n\"Yes, we're in favor of competition, but my idea of competition is winner takes all, and we don't have that kind of a situation here,\" he continued.\n\nThe House Armed Services Committee passed the bill Wednesday. The bill must be approved by the entire House then matched by a Senate version and signed by Obama before becoming law.",

    "context": "(CNN) -- After nearly 40 years of recorded increases, the number of immigrants living in the United States remained flat between 2007 and 2008, recent statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau show.\n\nThe number of naturalized citizens in the U.S. increased, partly attributed to voter drives for the 2008 election.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, the U.S. foreign-born population represented about 12.5 percent of the population in 2008, down from 12.6 percent in 2007.\n\nTaking into account the margin of error, it was possible that the immigrant population remained even.\n\n\"Between '07 and '08 there really wasn't that much of a change,\" said Elizabeth Grieco, chief of immigration statistics staff at the Census Bureau.\n\nBut given the steep upward trend in the foreign-born population since 1970, no change is big news.\n\nThe American Community Survey collects data from about 3 million addresses each year, and provides one of the most complete pictures of the population, according to the bureau.\n\nThe survey doesn't give a reason for the leveling off, but experts pointed to the economic downturn and the resulting high unemployment as factors behind the shift.\n\n\"The recession has had a significant effect on immigrants' decisions on whether to come to the U.S.,\" said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\nWould-be unauthorized immigrants and legal temporary workers are mostly the ones who have decided to stay put in their home countries for now, Mittelstadt said.\n\nThe largest declines in the foreign-born population were in states that were hardest hit by the recession, including California, Florida and Arizona.\n\nMittelstadt noted, however, that those immigrants already in the United States appear to be staying.\n\nA recent study by the Pew Hispanic Center concluded that emigration from Mexico, the largest source of immigrants to the United States, slowed at least 40 percent between mid-decade and 2008, based on national population surveys in the United States and Mexico, as well as Border Patrol apprehension figures.\n\nThe Mexican-born population in the United States dropped by about 300,000 between 2007 and 2008, according to census data.\n\nThe new Census statistics show that for the first time since the American Community Survey was fully implemented in 2005, the number of noncitizens decreased, Grieco said.\n\nThere were about 21.6 million noncitizens in 2008, down from 21.9 million in 2007. The label noncitizens includes both legal residents and illegal immigrants.\n\nAlong with the decline in the noncitizen population, however, there was a notable increase in the number of naturalized citizens, Grieco said.\n\nThe number of individuals who are naturalized citizens increased to 43 percent of the foreign-born population in 2008 from 42.5 percent in 2007.\n\nThe Census survey matches reports from the Department of Homeland Security on the rise of naturalization applications.\n\n\"Naturalizations grew at a record pace between 2006 and 2008, with a total of 2.4 million immigrants becoming new citizens in the United States,\" according to a DHS statement.\n\nA significant fee increase imposed in 2007 for naturalization applications and an awareness of citizenship brought on during voter registration drives for the 2008 election help explain the increase, Mittelstadt said.",
