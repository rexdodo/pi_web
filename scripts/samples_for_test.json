    "context": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Four militants armed with guns and grenades stormed a mosque in Rawalpindi frequented by military personnel, killing dozens of people Friday -- most of them children, the military said.\n\nThe attack is the latest to shake the garrison city since this year's launch of strong military offensives against Taliban insurgents in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan. Rawalpindi is the headquarters of the Pakistani army.\n\nMaj. Gen. Athar Abbas said Friday's assault killed 36 people and wounded 75.\n\nAmong the dead were 17 children, according to the military's Web site. Also killed were an army general and eight other military officials, six of them of senior rank. The remaining fatalities were adults.\n\n\"As soon as the mosque's security staff checked me, there was a blast and then a finger hit me, then there was another,\" Ishtiaq, a driver for a military officer, told GEO TV.\n\nIshtiaq, who uses only one name, was attending midday prayers.\n\nRawalpindi is near Islamabad, and the mosque is near national army headquarters. It is located inside a walled residential compound where many military families have homes.\n\nA witness told GEO TV there were up to 300 worshippers at the mosque at the time of the attack.\n\nThe militants hurled grenades before opening fire, Rawalpindi Police Chief Aslam Tareen told CNN. He said all the militants died, but he doesn't know how.\n\n\"These are not militants,\" Abbas said. \"These are terrorists who killed innocent worshippers.\"\n\nRetired Gen. Muhammad Yousaf was killed in the attack, said Col. Baseer Haider, a military spokesman. He said Yousaf was a former vice chief of army staff who was second in command during the administration of President Pervez Musharraf.\n\nAbbas said two of the attackers were suicide bombers who blew themselves up inside the Parade Lane mosque; the other two were shot and killed by security forces outside the mosque.\n\nSeveral explosions were heard inside the mosque around 1:30 p.m. (3:30 a.m. ET), followed by gunfire, Abbas said. The militants entered the compound by climbing over a wall, Tareen said.\n\nThis is the first attack in Rawalpindi since a suicide bomber targeted a bank on November 2.\n\nOn October 10, militants stormed army headquarters in Rawalpindi, taking several people hostage before security forces killed them.\n\nCNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.",

Her husband, the late Aaron Spelling, produced \"Charlie's Angels.\" Spelling talks about her relationship with Fawcett and why she believes she did the documentary.\n\nThe following is an edited version of the interview.\n\nLarry King: Did you first meet Farrah in connection with getting that part?\n\nCandy Spelling: Yes. Actually, she did a lot of small, little parts in the movies for Aaron starting around 1973. So it's been, my God, 36, 37 years since I, you know, first met her.  Watch Candy Spelling talk about her friendship with Farrah Fawcett »\n\nKing: So you knew her well during all that time?\n\nSpelling: Yes.\n\nKing: Did you know about her getting picked to be on \"Charlie's Angels?\"\n\nSpelling: I remember. She did some small roles. I think the one that Aaron really decided he was really going to use her was this American beauty pageant and, also, it was like \"Murder on Flight 502.\" He did the 90-minute versions.\n\nKing: Movie of the week?\n\nSpelling: Right. Movie of the weeks.\n\nKing: When did you know she had cancer?\n\nSpelling: I found out about a year -- when I first heard, I don't know if it was a year or two years ago when we first heard, and I contacted her. I hadn't talked to her in a while. She said, \"I'm going to be all right, Candy. Everything is going to be all right.\"\n\nKing: Why do you think, Candy, she did the documentary?\n\nSpelling: I think that she wanted to give other people courage that, you know, are fighting this kind of thing. I know how, you know, devastating the press, you know, was with Aaron when he had cancer. And it's just so difficult. And I mean, you know, it's hard to have a private life at that point.\n\nKing: Why do the tabloids get so tough on someone in such pain?\n\nSpelling: It's news. It's kind of a sad thing. I'm always so sorry to see it. But, you know, people believe what they see, and a lot of times, we don't know how true it really is.",

She said she wouldn't call it a formal investigation.\n\nThe Chinese women's gymnastics team won a gold medal in a team competition at the Summer Olympics Games. Five members won medals in individual competitions.\n\nYet commentators, bloggers and others have raised questions about whether about half the members of China's team were old enough to compete -- athletes must be at least 16 in the year the games take place.\n\nIn women's gymnastics, younger teenage girls can have an advantage over older competitors due to their often smaller, more agile bodies and lighter frames.\n\n\"We have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number questions and apparent discrepancies on this case,\" Davis said.\n\nA top Chinese Olympic official said questions regarding the ages of the athletes have been dealt with previously.\n\n\"The eligibility of the athletes has already been investigated and authorized by the international federation and, if they hadn't been cleared, they wouldn't have participated in the games,\" said Wang Wei, executive vice president of the Beijing Olympic Committee.\n\nChinese officials provided the Olympic committee with passports, showing that team members were of legal age, but numerous challenges have been made.\n\nThe latest came from a blogger known as \"Stryde Hax.\" The blogger claims to have uncovered proof that Chinese gymnast He Kexin is only 14.  Watch bloggers question China's gymnasts »\n\nIn Internet searches, \"Stryde Hax\" allegedly uncovered Web pages showing lists complied by China's General Administration of Sport that show a 1994 date of birth for He. That would make her 14 -- too young to compete in the Olympic Games.\n\nCNN has not been able to independently verify the information, but snapshots of the Web pages appear to back up the claim. Other bloggers have joined the search and reported similar results.\n\nThe New York Times conducted its own investigation, producing similar results that seem to implicate He and two other members of the team. The Times uncovered a 2006 biography on He that lists her birthday as January 1, 1994.\n\n\"According to online sports registration lists in China, half the team - He Kexin, Yang Yilin, Jiang Yuyuan - would be under age,\" the Times reported in July.\n\nThe International Gymnastics Federation, however, has said that those gymnasts were eligible and that the ages on their passports were correct.\n\nChinese gymnastics coaches defended their team Friday.\n\n\"Our athletes participating in these games all conform to the age regulations of the Olympics,\" said Huang Yubin, head coach of the men's and women's teams.\n\n\"Asians have different figures than people from the West, so that's what caused their suspicion,\" Huang said, referring to media inquiries. \"They shouldn't be suspicious.\"\n\nCNN's John Vause contributed to this story",

Watch more about the campaign against Schall »\n\nSchall told CNN he had never before been subjected to such a level of racial hatred.\n\n\"I am shocked,\" he said Thursday at a campaign event in Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia. \"I simply cannot believe that people would do this to fellow humans.\"\n\nSchall, who appears on a CDU election poster, said he is scared.\n\n\"I have police patrolling at my house day and night, and some officers stay in my house overnight,\" he said.\n\nBut Schall said he is not thinking of leaving Germany and the CDU said he has the party's full support. Schall and the CDU said they have filed a lawsuit against the NPD.\n\nThe situation escalated Wednesday when the NPD's national leadership held a rally in Schall's adopted hometown of Hildburghausen. Party Chairman Udo Voigt tried to speak with Schall \"and persuade Mr. Schall that he is needed more in Angola than in Germany,\" the NPD said in a news release.\n\nPolice sent to protect Schall stopped the NPD's representatives from accessing Schall's premises.\n\nHe is campaigning for the CDU for a state election in Thuringia, which is in the former communist East Germany. Right-wing extremism is generally a bigger problem in eastern Germany than in the west of the country, and citizens of Hildburghausen told CNN that, though most people support the politician, fascism is a problem in the area.\n\n\"Of course we have a base of right-wingers here,\" a passer-by said at the market in the town's center.\n\nBut most of those questioned by CNN denounced the campaign against Schall and said he is a respected member of the community.\n\n\"I am not only a member of the CDU, I am also a voluntary firefighter at the local department,\" Schall said.\n\nFrank Schwerdt, the NPD's leader in Erfurt, tried to downplay the events.\n\n\"This is not a personal campaign against Mr. Schall,\" Schwerdt said. \"We simply feel that many citizens don't want foreigners to have a say in our politics.\"\n\nThe NPD has been under surveillance by Germany's Office for the Protection of the Constitution for alleged contacts with illegal neo-Nazi groups. However, past efforts to ban the party have failed on technical grounds.\n\nThe NPD denies ties to illegal groups.\n\nBut members of the Christian Democratic Union told CNN that, since the racist campaign started against Schall, he has received several death threats and the party will no longer allow him to do media interviews because of the risks.\n\nAt Thursday's campaign event in central Erfurt, increased police presence was noticeable and CDU members said plainclothes officers had been dispatched among the crowd.",

He is in Italian custody and is awaiting extradition to Rwanda.\n\nAccording to Interpol's statement, the Rwandan arrest warrant says Uwayezu was alleged \"to have acted individually and as part of a conspiracy to plan and commit genocide by instigating Hutus to kill Tutsis in the area of Gikongoro, as director of the Groupe Scolaire Marie Merci college in Kibeho.\"\n\nHe is accused of \"participating in meetings with government and military authorities which allegedly planned the extermination of the Tutsi ethnic group\" and \"complicity in the massacre of some 80 students in May 1994 in the college which he headed.\"\n\nUwayezu arrived in Italy in 1997, took an alias, and was working as a vicar at the Church in Empoli commune near Florence when he was seized, Interpol said.\n\nThe man was identified after Interpol's fugitives unit received information and pictures from Rwandan authorities.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Florence issued a statement about the arrest two days ago, saying it hopes the justice system will come up with the truth about the case.\n\nBut, it said, \"we stand by the fact that Don Emmanuel has always declared his estrangement to the events in question and we accompany him in prayers.\"\n\nOne Italian news report noted that Uwayezu is a priest of Hutu ethnicity and lived and worked as vice-parish priest in Ponzano, part of the county of Empoli.\n\nDon Guido Engels, the head of the parish and a priest, told the ASCA news agency that \"Don Emmanuel never cultivated feelings towards another ethnic group. He always wanted peace.\"\n\n\"The arrest of Uwayezu demonstrates the power and effectiveness of international co-operation between police worldwide in obtaining information in relation to the identification, location and apprehension of fugitives around the world,\" said Jean-Michel Louboutin, Interpol's executive director of police services.\n\n\"This operation is a credit to law enforcement officers and agencies in Italy and Rwanda.\"\n\nTwo years ago, Interpol created a unit dedicated to searching for fugitives in the genocide who were wanted by Rwanda and the U.N.-sponsored International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. So far, seven people wanted by Rwanda and five wanted by the tribunal have been arrested.\n\nPolice in Uganda recently arrested and extradited a man who is among the most wanted suspects from the Rwandan genocide. Idelphonse Nizeyimana was picked up at a hotel in Rubaga, a suburb of the capital, Kampala.\n\nThe arrest, by Ugandan police, was part of an operation between the tribunal, Ugandan authorities, and Interpol. Nizeyimana was transferred Tuesday to a U.N. detention facility in Arusha, Tanzania, where the tribunal is based.\n\nThe 1994 Rwandan genocide left an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus dead over a 100-day period, the United Nations and Interpol say. Millions more were raped and disfigured, and nearly an entire generation of children lost their parents.",

    "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates says he will urge President Obama to veto a coming $726 billion defense authorization bill if it contains funding for unwanted projects Gates has been trying to cut for years.\n\nGates has been vocal about financial reform at the Pentagon, trying to rein in some big-ticket contracts and telling Congress to stop spending money on C-17 transport planes that are not needed and a $485 million alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The JSF engine program -- already delayed and over budget -- could end up costing taxpayers billions of dollars, according to Gates.\n\nBut with jobs at stake, Congress has ignored those requests for years and continued to appropriate funds for the C-17 and a second F-35 engine.\n\n\"The detailed conditions they [Congress] have imposed on the overall JSF program would make it essentially un-executable and impose unacceptable schedule and budget costs,\" Gates said Thursday at a Pentagon briefing.\n\n\"As I have stated repeatedly, should the Congress insist on adding funding for a costly and unnecessary JSF extra engine or direct changes that seriously disrupt the JSF program, or impose additional C-17 aircraft, I will strongly recommend that the president veto such legislation,\" he said.\n\nThe Pentagon believes the proposal for the new engine, made by General Electric, would end up costing about $2.9 billion which includes re-working the engine already being tested because there is concern it does not meet the performance needs for the F-35. Those costs would be picked up by taxpayer dollars, according to Pentagon estimates.\n\nAdditionally the contract for the new proposal by Congress would require cutting the purchase of the current engine by half to let the General Electric engine purchase catch up, according to Gates.\n\n\"Only in Washington does a proposal where everybody wins get considered a competition, where everybody is guaranteed a piece of the action at the end,\" Gates said.\n\n\"Yes, we're in favor of competition, but my idea of competition is winner takes all, and we don't have that kind of a situation here,\" he continued.\n\nThe House Armed Services Committee passed the bill Wednesday. The bill must be approved by the entire House then matched by a Senate version and signed by Obama before becoming law.",

    "context": "(CNN) -- After nearly 40 years of recorded increases, the number of immigrants living in the United States remained flat between 2007 and 2008, recent statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau show.\n\nThe number of naturalized citizens in the U.S. increased, partly attributed to voter drives for the 2008 election.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, the U.S. foreign-born population represented about 12.5 percent of the population in 2008, down from 12.6 percent in 2007.\n\nTaking into account the margin of error, it was possible that the immigrant population remained even.\n\n\"Between '07 and '08 there really wasn't that much of a change,\" said Elizabeth Grieco, chief of immigration statistics staff at the Census Bureau.\n\nBut given the steep upward trend in the foreign-born population since 1970, no change is big news.\n\nThe American Community Survey collects data from about 3 million addresses each year, and provides one of the most complete pictures of the population, according to the bureau.\n\nThe survey doesn't give a reason for the leveling off, but experts pointed to the economic downturn and the resulting high unemployment as factors behind the shift.\n\n\"The recession has had a significant effect on immigrants' decisions on whether to come to the U.S.,\" said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\nWould-be unauthorized immigrants and legal temporary workers are mostly the ones who have decided to stay put in their home countries for now, Mittelstadt said.\n\nThe largest declines in the foreign-born population were in states that were hardest hit by the recession, including California, Florida and Arizona.\n\nMittelstadt noted, however, that those immigrants already in the United States appear to be staying.\n\nA recent study by the Pew Hispanic Center concluded that emigration from Mexico, the largest source of immigrants to the United States, slowed at least 40 percent between mid-decade and 2008, based on national population surveys in the United States and Mexico, as well as Border Patrol apprehension figures.\n\nThe Mexican-born population in the United States dropped by about 300,000 between 2007 and 2008, according to census data.\n\nThe new Census statistics show that for the first time since the American Community Survey was fully implemented in 2005, the number of noncitizens decreased, Grieco said.\n\nThere were about 21.6 million noncitizens in 2008, down from 21.9 million in 2007. The label noncitizens includes both legal residents and illegal immigrants.\n\nAlong with the decline in the noncitizen population, however, there was a notable increase in the number of naturalized citizens, Grieco said.\n\nThe number of individuals who are naturalized citizens increased to 43 percent of the foreign-born population in 2008 from 42.5 percent in 2007.\n\nThe Census survey matches reports from the Department of Homeland Security on the rise of naturalization applications.\n\n\"Naturalizations grew at a record pace between 2006 and 2008, with a total of 2.4 million immigrants becoming new citizens in the United States,\" according to a DHS statement.\n\nA significant fee increase imposed in 2007 for naturalization applications and an awareness of citizenship brought on during voter registration drives for the 2008 election help explain the increase, Mittelstadt said.",

Advised by her doctor to let the miscarriage occur naturally, Michelle, 45, was being cared for at home by her family.\n\nFollowing the miscarriage late Sunday night, Michelle began to feel lightheaded and as a precaution was taken to the hospital, where she was kept for observation, according to a family spokesperson. Michelle is recovering well and expected to return home later on Monday, the spokesperson adds.\n\nRELATED: Michelle Duggar Resting at Home, Plans to Name Child\n\n\"We have had many tears today,\" says Jim Bob Duggar, 46. \"This is life, and I understand that we are going though something that many others have. You think about the what-ifs, but God gives us strength to go on. We won't be able to see this child's life and the phases that we've seen for our other children, but we know we will see this child in heaven one day. We are thankful for each child, and we are blessed to have the children we have here and the ones we will meet someday in heaven.\"\n\nJubilee Duggar's memorial service will be for friends and Duggar family members, who on late Sunday already held a private service in their home.\n\n\"We would like to thank everyone for their prayers, emails and outpouring of love,\" Jim Bob wrote in a letter he shared with PEOPLE. \"As our whole family is grieving, we also know that God promises to work all things for good in our lives. Our prayer is that Jubilee's passing will help us all realize that this life is short, and our relationship with Jesus is the most important thing. He gives us a peace in our hearts as He guides us through whatever we might face.\"\n\nThough the family is in mourning, Jim Bob says they are grateful for the health of youngest daughter, Josie, who turned 2 on December 10. Josie survived against all odds after being born at just 25 weeks and 1 lb., 6 oz. and has developed normally with no lasting impairments.\n\n\"We were looking forward to this birthday because it is a milestone for her,\" he says. \"It is wonderful that she is with us and doing so well.\"\n\nSee full article at PEOPLE.com.\n\n© 2011 People and Time Inc.

In May it lost a 62-square-mile chunk.\n\nThat meant the \"bridge\" of ice connecting Wilkins to the islands was just 984 yards wide at its narrowest location, the ESA said.\n\nFurther rifts developed in October and November, said Angelika Humbert of the Institute of Geophysics at Germany's Muenster University.\n\n\"During the last year the ice shelf has lost about 1800 square kilometers (694 square miles), or about 14 percent of its size,\" Humbert said.\n\nAntarctica's ice sheet was formed over thousands of years by accumulated and compacted snow. Along the coast, the ice gradually floats on the sea, forming massive ledges known as ice shelves, the ESA says.\n\nSeveral of these ice shelves, including seven in the past 20 years, have retreated and disintegrated.\n\nThe Wilkins Ice Shelf had been stable for most of the past century before it began retreating in the 1990s.\n\n\"It had been there almost unchanged since the first expeditions which mapped it back in the 1930s, so it had a very long period of real stability, and it's only in the last decade that it's started to retreat,\" Vaughan said.\n\nWilkins is the size of the state of Connecticut, or about half the area of Scotland. It is the largest ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula yet to be threatened.\n\nIf the ice shelf breaks away from the peninsula, it will not cause a rise in sea level because it is already floating, scientists say. Some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse.\n\nThe Antarctic Peninsula is the piece of the continent that stretches toward South America.",

Another three were killed in Hama province.\n\nThe Local Coordination Committee of Syria reported that Syrian security forces were storming the Damascus suburb of Zabadany and were shelling housing and positioning snipers. The group also announced, in a separate incident, the killing of Dr. Ibrahim Nahel Othman, who they described as \"one of the most important physicians in the Syrian Revolution.\" He was killed by gunfire near the Turkish border, the group said.\n\nAnother group, the Coalition of Free Damascus for Peaceful Change, said that the doctor was a wanted man because he performed many surgeries on wounded protesters.\n\nThe reported deaths came amid tensions in Homs -- a center of regime arrests -- as military troops manned more than 60 checkpoints inside the city and surrounded it, according to the Syrian National Council, a leading opposition movement.\n\nA feared full-scale crackdown did not happen Saturday, but activists posted a video Saturday that they said showed the military harassing residents of Homs.\n\nMourners on Friday went to bury a 10-year-old boy, Maher al-Husseini, who was allegedly killed by a sniper's bullet in his own home.\n\nThe video shows the boy wrapped in a white sheet and carried by men in street towards a cemetery. Some of the men chant \"The martyrs blood will not be lost in vain,\" as the lifeless boy is carried.\n\nAs the men walk towards the cemetery, gunfire can be heard. They get to the cemetery and start digging as gunfire continues to ring out.\n\nCNN could not independently confirm what was depicted in the videos. Western networks are not allowed inside the embattled country.\n\nThe United Nations said last week that more than 4,000 people have died in Syria since a government crackdown against protesters erupted in mid-March. The regime's actions have outraged world powers and sparked sanctions by the Arab League, Turkey, the United States and the European Union.\n\nThe council said the Bashar al-Assad regime is \"driving violent sectarian incidents to justify this potential murder.\" More than 30 corpses -- all thought to be victims of sectarian violence -- were found Monday in Homs.\n\nThe city of Homs is in a province of the same name.",

    "context": "(CNN)  -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson hailed his side's rollercoaster 4-3 victory over neighbors Manchester City at Old Trafford as the \"best derby of all time.\"\n\nFerguson and substitute Gary Neville celebrate Owen's late winner.\n\nFerguson made the claim while ruing his side's sloppy defensive play which allowed City to claim three equalizing goals before Michael Owen's clinical winner deep into injury time on Sunday.\n\n\"It could have been an embarrassment, 6-0 or 7-0, if we defended our proper way,\" claimed the legendary Scot.\n\n\"We could have won by a big score but by making mistakes, which was the essence of the game, we probably were in the best derby game of all time.\n\n\"What do you choose? Win the best derby game of all time or win 6-0? I'd probably pick 6-0.\" Was this the greatest derby ever?\n\nThe build-up to the match had been marked by a war of words between Ferguson and City manager Mark Hughes, who has been handed a massive transfer budget by his side's Abu Dhabi owners.\n\nFerguson had branded them \"cocky\" and did little to dampen down the rivalry with his post match comments.\n\nBlog:Should referees also keep time?\n\n\"Sometimes you have a noisy neighbor. You cannot do anything about that. They will always be noisy,\" he said.\n\n\"You just have to get on with your life, put your television on and turn it up a bit louder.\n\n\"Today the players showed their form. That is the best answer of all.\"\n\nBy contrast, City manager Mark Hughes was furious with referee Martin Atkinson for the amount of added time played, with Owen scoring in the 96th minute.\n\n\"We need an explanation because I don't know why the referee has added that amount of time on,\" said Hughes.\n\n\"We just feel a little bit aggrieved that they were given that time.\"\n\nIt was a heartbreaking finale for his team with Bellamy's magnificent second goal after a mistake by Rio Ferdinand appearing to give his up and coming side a share of the spoils.\n\n\"We're disappointed, we put in a hell of a shift today,\" said Hughes. \"Craig Bellamy scored two magnificent goals. He didn't deserve to be on the losing side,\" added Hughes.\n\nFerguson, who has used free transfer signing Owen sparingly this season, said the England striker showed his true quality.\n\n\"His positional play, first touch and finish were absolutely superb. World class.\"\n\nThe victory took United to second place in the English Premier League behind pacesetting Chelsea with City suffering their first defeat of the season.",

    "context": "(CNN)  -- At least 10 people were killed, and an unknown number remained missing Wednesday, after a boat authorities believe was used for human smuggling capsized off the coast of Florida.\n\nThe Coast Guard said it rescued 26 people from a capsized boat off the coast of Florida.\n\nAlmost all of the victims are believed to be from Haiti and the Bahamas, according to the U.S. Coast Guard -- which said a dangerous number of people was packed onto a small pleasure cruiser.\n\nThe Coast Guard said it rescued 26 people from the boat, and searchers didn't know how many more people had been on the boat.\n\n\"You don't put 26 people on a small boat. It was way overloaded, completely unsafe,\" said Capt. Jim Fitton, the Coast Guard's sector commander in Miami, Florida. \"With smugglers, you have the potential for this because smugglers aren't interested in people's welfare. They're interested in making money.\"\n\nThe boat capsized about 15 miles east of Boynton Beach, Florida, some time around 2 a.m. Wednesday, the Coast Guard said. The agency was notified more than nine hours later by someone who saw the boat.\n\nThere were women and children on the boat, Fitton said. A pregnant woman was taken to a hospital, while most of the victims remained onboard a Coast Guard cutter that was being used in the continuing rescue efforts, he said.\n\nOnly eight of the people rescued by Wednesday afternoon were wearing life jackets.\n\nThe Rev. Luke Harrigan, a Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, pastor to members of the Haitian community who is working with the Coast Guard, said he is contacting family members of the victims who were killed.\n\n\"Most of them now didn't even know they were coming to the United States,\" he said. \"Sometimes the person organizing the trip doesn't even tell them where they are going.\"\n\nHe said it's not uncommon for smugglers to charge people from the impoverished island nation as much as $4,000 for passage into the United States.\n\nCoast Guard rescuers were continuing to search the area of the crash Wednesday evening.",

It asked manufacturers to design bags that give X-ray machines a clear, unobstructed view of the laptops.\n\nSome 60 manufacturers responded to the TSA's solicitation, with 40 of them submitting prototypes for testing. About a dozen manufacturers are currently advertising checkpoint-friendly bags.\n\nMany of the bags are deceptively simple. One common design resembles a clam shell. The case unzips into two, with one side holding the computer and the other holding computer peripherals, keys and other personal items. All of the bags are devoid of metal zippers, clips and buckles on the side of the bag that holds the computer.  Learn about the TSA's laptop bag requirements »\n\nTravelers at Reagan National Airport near Washington had different opinions on the hassles of carrying computers but were uniformly supportive of having checkpoint-friendly bags.\n\n\"Sign me up,\" said traveler Seth Robertson, who was carrying a computer bag and a large, stuffed pony, a present for a friend in Nicaragua.\n\nGetting the computer through the checkpoint was more difficult than the stuffed animal, he said.\n\n\"The laptop, I have to take out of the bag and put it separately,\" Robertson said, whereas the pony, he could \"just stuff right through.\"\n\nScreeners didn't even look the gift horse in the mouth.\n\nThe TSA says about one-third of all air travelers carry laptops. And the current screening procedures are cumbersome for travelers who sometimes leave laptops at the checkpoints in their haste.  Watch a screening demonstration with a new laptop bag »\n\nIn fact, about 4,800 laptops are lost at airport checkpoints every day, according to a study conducted this year by the Ponemon Institute for the Dell computer company. It is not known how may are quickly recovered, an institute official said.\n\nBut a checkpoint-friendly carrying case could potentially alleviate problems caused when folks grab the wrong computer by mistake, or grab the bag and forget the computer, he said.\n\nTSA spokeswoman Ellen Howe said the bags may even improve speed at checkpoints. \"Less time (is) spent putting things in the bin and putting things back in at the other end, so it may help the process along,\" she said.\n\nFor a bag to meet TSA requirements, it must meet the following five standards:\n\nThe TSA says it is not approving or endorsing any bag design, but it says manufacturers have stepped up to the plate, providing a number of bags that qualify.",

Its high-grossing debut -- the best ever for Presidents Day -- coupled with solid numbers from the other two new wide releases put 2010's holiday frame into the record books with an estimated total gross of $193 million.\n\n\"Percy Jackson & The Olympians,\" based on the popular kids' book series by author Rick Riordan, earned an estimated $31.1 million for the three days while the R-rated horror remake \"Wolfman,\" starring Benicio del Toro, grossed an estimated $30.6 million for a per-theater average of $9,497.\n\n\"Avatar,\" in its ninth weekend of release, grossed another $22 million, falling only 4 percent from its previous weekend and putting its total cume close to $660 million.\n\nLast weekend's winner, \"Dear John,\" dropped into fifth place for the frame. Losing 50 percent of its value, primarily off of \"Valentine's Day\" competition, the film earned $15.3 million. Its total stands at $53 million.\n\nThese strong numbers from female-driven films have Hollywood noticing that women are strong drivers of box office.

    "context": "(CNN) -- As reports of swine flu continue to rise in the United States and around the world, the average American is probably asking, \"How should I protect myself?\"\n\nU.S. health officials stress the importance of frequent hand washing during outbreaks of illness.\n\nHealth officials' advice is to follow common-sense precautions: Wash your hands, stay home if you're sick and listen to your local health authorities.\n\n\"Very frequent hand-washing is something that we talk about time and time again and that is an effective way to reduce transmission of disease,\" said Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"If you're sick, it's very important that people stay at home. If your children are sick, have a fever and flu-like illness, they shouldn't go to school. And if you're ill, you shouldn't get on an airplane or another public transport to travel. Those things are part of personal responsibility in trying to reduce the impact. \"\n\nSo far, Mexico has been hardest hit by swine flu. Cases have been confirmed in the United States, as well as countries including Canada, New Zealand, Spain, United Kingdom, and Israel.\n\n\"In areas with no disease yet, a lot of what we can do sounds simple and repetitive but helps,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim deputy director of the CDC's Science and Public Health Program. In addition to washing hands often, she recommends covering your mouth when coughing and sneezing and avoiding touching your eyes and nose in case the virus is on your hands.\n\nThe World Health Organization calls the situation a \"public health emergency of international concern,\" and the United States has declared a \"public health emergency,\" likened by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to preparations for a potential hurricane. No authorities are calling the outbreak a pandemic.\n\nThe CDC expects U.S. numbers will grow and recommendations will change depending on what happens in individual communities, said the CDC's Schuchat. The public should pay attention to what is happening nearby and heed the guidance of local health officials regarding school, work and public events.\n\nBecause so much is still unknown at this point, the main risk factor is people traveling to areas where cases have already been identified. \"However this virus may already be in other places in the United States,\" CDC spokesman Tom Skinner told CNN. \"With enhanced surveillance, we will see more cases and that is why it makes good sense to be proactive, by doing things we know are effective in reducing exposure.\"  Explainer: Swine flu facts »\n\nSchuchat noted swine flu symptoms are relatively general and nonspecific. \"So many different things can cause these symptoms. it is a dilemma,\" she said. \"It is a challenge that we are wrestling with. There is not a perfect test right now to let a person or doctor know exactly what this is.\"\n\nBut Schuchat specifically advised anyone who feels ill after returning from Mexico to see a doctor.\n\nUnfortunately, since this is a new strain of influenza, the flu vaccine for this past flu season offers no protection. \"However, we do have anti-virals that work against this swine flu,\" said Skinner, referring to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). \"Someone who has [swine flu], if they are treated early, the anti-flu medicines work against this.\"\n\nAccording to Skinner, health officials are still trying to figure out where exactly the virus originated, how transmissible it is and why it is mild in some cases and deadlier in others.\n\nCNN's Mary Carter contributed to this report.",

    "context": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The three security guards and the driver of an American development expert who was abducted in Pakistan on Saturday have been detained for questioning, a police official said Monday.\n\nThe four men are not considered suspects at this point, said the official, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Under Pakistani law, police can detain someone for up to 72 hours without charging them with a crime.\n\nInvestigators have no leads in the case and are not any closer to finding out what happened to the American, whom the U.S. Embassy identified as Warren Weinstein.\n\nWeinstein was abducted early Saturday when gunmen, posing as neighbors offering food, pistol-whipped him and his driver and tied up his guards, U.S. Embassy and Pakistani officials said.\n\nWeinstein works for J.E. Austin Associates Inc., a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia, a Pakistani official said. He's is a world-renowned development expert, with 25 years of experience, according to his company's website. The site says he was heading what the company described as the \"Pakistan Initiative for Strategic Development and Competitiveness.\"\n\nAs Weinstein's security guards prepared for the meal before the Ramadan fast early Saturday, three men knocked at the front gate and offered food for the meal -- a traditional practice among Muslims during the Ramadan holy month, according to senior Lahore police official Tajamal Hussain.\n\nOnce the gate was opened, the three men forced their way in while five other suspects entered the house from the back, Hussain said. The men tied up the three security guards and duct-taped their mouths, he said. They pistol-whipped the driver and forced him to take them to Weinstein's room, where the men hit Weinstein in the head with a pistol, and forced him out of the house and into a waiting car, Hussain said.\n\nHe said Weinstein is in his 60s.\n\nThere has been no claim of responsibility nor any demands by any groups, according to senior police official Awais Ahmed.\n\nWeinstein has lived in the residence in an upscale Lahore neighborhood for several years, Ahmed said.\n\nWeinstein is a Fulbright Scholar in Belgium and is proficient in six languages, with a doctorate in international law and economics, according to his company website.\n\nU.S. Embassy officials are working with Pakistani authorities on the case, Embassy spokesman Alberto Rodriguez said Saturday.\n\nThe U.S. State Department updated a travel advisory for Americans traveling and working in Pakistan this week, warning that extremist groups operating in the country were continuing to target U.S. and other Western citizens and interests.\n\nIt cited part of the reason for the advisory as \"reported\" abductions of U.S. citizens \"for ransom or personal reasons,\" including the kidnapping of a U.S. citizen in Lahore in June. No further details about that incident were released.\n\nAbductions are not unusual in Pakistan, though those targeted are typically Pakistani rather than American or Western.\n\nIn early July, a Swiss couple was grabbed at gunpoint while traveling in the town of Loralai in the volatile southwestern Balochistan province, provincial officials said at the time.\n\nThree weeks after their abduction, Pakistani authorities said they believed the couple was still alive.\n\nWeinstein's abduction follows another high-profile incident involving an American in Lahore.\n\nRaymond Davis, a CIA contractor, was charged with killing two men in January but was released in March after compensation was paid to their families.\n\nJournalists Nasir Habib and Shaan Khan and CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.",

Security Council resolutions.\" In a statement Thursday, a NATO official said, \"At no time during Operation Unified Protector has NATO targeted specific individuals.\"\n\nThe ICC had previously issued a warrant for Gadhafi's arrest, accusing him of crimes against humanity.\n\nThe ICC still has warrants for the arrest of Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi.\n\nQuestions surround the death of Moammar Gadhafi, who eluded forces loyal to the National Transitional Council for months. Video shows Gadhafi was alive when captured by the opposition.\n\nHe died from a shot in the head, officials said, but the circumstances surrounding the shot remain unclear.\n\nThe United States said it supports an independent investigation, as called for by the United Nations and by Libya's new leadership.\n\nCeccaldi said the Gadhafi family's complaint will be filed in the coming days.\n\n\"Now we will wait and see if the ICC is a judicial system which is independent and impartial,\" he added.\n\nLt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, commander of the NATO military operation, said earlier this week that NATO \"did not get involved in anything beyond what was our legal mandate and we remain well within the mandate assigned to us by the North Atlantic Council.\"\n\nWhile Gadhafi survived an airstrike in the Sirte area shortly before he died, Bouchard said NATO did not know the former Libyan leader was in the convoy.\n\n\"We saw a convoy, and in fact we had no idea that Gadhafi was on board,\" Bouchard said. Some vehicles in the convoy were carrying weaponry, and seemed to present a potential threat to the population, he said.\n\nThe news came as the U.N.

    "context": "(CNN) -- A Tampa judge denied bail Wednesday for a Florida man charged with first-degree murder in the death of a 3-month-old child, who authorities say was thrown out of a moving car.\n\nPolice say infant Emanuel Murray died after his mother's ex-boyfriend threw him from a car on a Florida interstate.\n\nRichard Anthony McTear Jr., 21, was arrested Tuesday, hours after a confrontation at his former girlfriend's apartment in which he snatched the infant, Emanuel Wesley Murray, the Hillsborough County sheriff's office said.\n\nThe child's body was found about 4 .am. Tuesday on the side of Interstate 275 in Tampa, Florida, by a local television photographer on his way to work. The photographer, WTVT's Jason Bird, said he stopped when he spotted something by the roadside\n\n\"It had to be a baby doll but it was too big to be a doll,\" Bird told CNN affiliate WFTS in Tampa. \"I almost passed out, I started shaking,\" said Bird.\n\nA preliminary autopsy determined the child died of blunt trauma to the head, the county medical examiner's office said.\n\nPolice were called to the apartment of McTear's former girlfriend about 3:15 a.m. Tuesday. The mother, Jasmine Bedwell, 17, told investigators that McTear had hit her several times and threatened \"to kill the both of y'all,\" the sheriff's department said in a statement announcing the charges.\n\nMcTear threw a car seat containing the child across the room during the fight, causing the boy to fall onto the apartment's concrete floor, investigators said. He then picked up the boy and drove off in his blue Chevrolet Impala, throwing the child out while on the interstate, the sheriff's department said.\n\nVideo on CNN affiliate WFLA TV showed McTear being led out of a Tampa police squad car after his arrest. He ducked his head as TV cameras surrounded him on his walk into a police building.\n\nWhen asked by reporters if he had thrown the child out of the car window, McTear answered, \"It's a dirty game. A dirty game.\"\n\nMcTear is not related to the child, said sheriff's spokeswoman Debbie Carter.\n\nMcTear is facing additional charges of burglary with battery, felony battery, aggravated child abuse and kidnapping, the sheriff's department said.",

    "context": "New York (CNN) -- An Austrian daredevil is planning to become the first person to break the sound barrier in a free fall, without riding in a vehicle.\n\nThis summer in New Mexico, Felix Baumgartner hopes to make the highest, longest and fastest fall ever.\n\nHis attempt will take him to an altitude where the atmosphere ends and space begins -- where blood boils at body temperature, and the air temperature could be as low as minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe first step in the attempt will be riding a helium balloon to an altitude of 120,000 feet above sea level -- almost 23 miles -- higher than anyone has ascended in a balloon before.\n\nThen, wearing a pressurized suit and oxygen tanks, he plans to jump out of his capsule for a five-minute fall back to Earth. Within the first 30 seconds, he expects to be falling faster than the speed of sound, which at that altitude is around 690 miles per hour. Crossing that barrier would mark a new test of the limits of the human body.\n\n\"This is what we want to find out: What happens to the human body when it breaks the speed of sound,\" Baumgartner said. \"That's a big question mark.\"\n\nTo increase his chances of survival, his parachute is set to open automatically, even if he's unconscious or spinning so fast his hands are pinned by the G-force. He said his engineers are taking every precaution, testing out the suit in a wind tunnel and providing him with a backup chute, sealed gloves and boots, and an advanced helmet.\n\n\"This helmet also has face-shield heating to make sure your visor's not getting fogged up on the way down, because that would be fatal,\" he said. \"If you don't see anything, you can't move anymore. You can't make decisions.\"\n\nStill, the risk of the unknown remains. \"If something happens, it happens fast,\" he said. \"You can never say you're not going to get killed under any circumstances,\" but \"we have a lot of solutions for emergency situations like this.\"\n\nA chain reaction of events would have to occur before the jump could turn fatal, he said.\n\nA potential benefit from the mission, he said, would be demonstrating that it is possible to return from space without a spacecraft.\n\n\"In the future, a lot more tourists will go and travel to space. And if something goes wrong with their spacecraft, they have to return to Earth somehow,\" he said. \"We will show to the world that egress from high altitude is survivable.\"\n\nThe main difference is that Baumgartner will start from a standstill, whereas astronauts in a craft like the space shuttle are traveling at orbital speeds close to 18,000 mph when their re-entry begins.\n\nThe previous record for the highest jump has stood for half a century, since it was set in 1960 by Joe Kittinger with the Air Force. He reached an altitude of 102,800 feet, and says it felt like a very distant and hostile place to be.\n\n\"You know that right outside of you is a vacuum of space,\" he said, \"and without the protection of that pressure suit, you cannot live. And that's an interesting thought.\"\n\nBaumgartner, whose attempt is being financed by energy drink maker Red Bull, has enlisted Kittinger as a consultant.\n\n\"We have learned a lot from people in the past who tried to break that record, and they all failed,\" Baumgartner said. \"Some of these people got killed.\"\n\nBut he adds, \"I think it's human nature, you know. Records are meant to be broken. And I'm a very competitive person. I like the challenge.\"",

    "context": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- An air traffic controller was joking with a woman about a dead cat just moments before a helicopter and small plane collided over the Hudson River in August, according to a recording released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe wreckage of a plane that collided with a helicopter is lifted on August 11 from the Hudson River.\n\nThere were no survivors from the August 8 crash, in which three people died aboard the Piper Saratoga PA-32 fixed-wing plane that collided with a helicopter carrying six people, five of them Italian tourists.\n\nThe FAA in August confirmed the air traffic controller at New Jersey's Teterboro airport, who initially handled the flight of the Piper before handing off to Newark controllers, had \"involved in apparently inappropriate conversations on the telephone at the time of the accident.\"\n\nThe controller and his supervisor, who was not in the building as required, were suspended.\n\n\"While we have no reason to believe at this time that these actions contributed to the accident, this kind of conduct is unacceptable, and we have placed the employees on administrative leave and have begun disciplinary proceedings,\" FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said at the time.\n\nThe recording, released for the first time Thursday, caught the air traffic controller at Teterboro airport having a giggly chat with the woman, suggesting she grill the dead cat she apparently found. A source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN the woman was the controller's girlfriend.\n\n\"That thing was disgusting,\" she says, to which the controller responds, \"Chinese people do it, so why can't we?\"\n\nThe exchange, which lasts about six minutes, is interrupted by a controller at the Newark airport, who asks the Teterboro controller for help with air traffic.\n\n\"Hey, Teterboro ... would you switch that guy, maybe put him on a two-twenty heading to get away from that other traffic please?\" the Newark controller is heard saying.\n\nThe Teterboro controller seems to be juggling both conversations, telling to woman to \"hold on real quick\" while asking the Newark controller to repeat the request.\n\n\"Can you switch that (Piper) PA-32?\" the Newark controller said.\n\nNeither is able to communicate with the pilot of the Piper, with the Teterboro controller saying, \"He's lost in the hertz.\"\n\nThe conversation between the Teterboro controller and the woman continues as she mentions that it seems her friend is doing \"a lot of babysitting.\"\n\nSeconds later, the crash occurs with no survivors.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has said that before the accident, Teterboro controller had switched control of the Piper plane to Newark tower, which the pilot never contacted.\n\nRaymond Adams, head of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, is representing the Teterboro controller. He declined to comment Thursday, except to say that \"the FAA has previously stated that the conversation had no connection to the crash.\"\n\nThe controller is still on paid administration leave pending further investing by the FAA, he added.\n\nThe helicopter was taking the tourists on a 12-minute Liberty Helicopter Sightseeing Tour around New York, while the plane carrying three individuals was headed for Ocean City, New Jersey. Controllers lost contact with the plane at 11:53 a.m. as it flew at an altitude of about 1,100 feet.\n\nThe FAA released the recording after a request from The Associated Press citing the Freedom of Information Act.",

John Paul spent six hours on an operating table and survived.\n\nFour days later he announced from his hospital bed he had forgiven the attempted assassin and urged the faithful to pray for Agca. The pope spent more than three weeks in Gemelli hospital recovering.\n\nAgca was arrested a few minutes after the attack, tried, and sentenced to 19 years in prison.\n\nHe has never explained why he tried to kill the pope. There has long been suspicion that he was working for an eastern European Communist government angry at the Polish-born pope's vocal anti-Communism. But on a 2002 visit to Bulgaria -- a focus of much speculation -- the pope said he did not believe the Balkan state was behind the attempt on his life.\n\nThe pope visited Agca in prison on December 27, 1983, and reportedly forgave him in person.\n\nAgca was granted clemency by the president of Italy in 2000, to John Paul's \"satisfaction,\" according to the Vatican.\n\nHe was then transferred to his native Turkey, where he was re-arrested for the murder of a Turkish journalist in 1979.\n\nAgca killed Abdi Ipekci in 1979, Anadolu said. Ipekci was editor-in-chief of the daily Milliyet.\n\nAgca was due to be taken to a military facility to assess his fitness for military service after his release. In 2006, a military hospital ruled that he was not fit for the obligatory military service due to a severe anti-social personality disorder, but the Ministry of National Defense did not approve the exemption, the Turkish news agency said.",

U.S. troops will remain in the province to support Iraqi forces.\n\nPresident George W. Bush described the transfer as a major victory against al-Qaeda extremists who once held sway in the area.\n\n\"Today, Anbar is no longer lost to al Qaeda -- it is al Qaeda that lost Anbar,\" he said in a statement.\n\nOnce dominated by Sunni insurgents, Anbar has been the scene of many attacks on U.S.-led troops in Iraq.\n\nNow a bastion of tribal opposition, it is also the scene of an internal Sunni political struggle between the Iraqi Islamic Party, one of Iraq's main Sunni parties, and the Awakening movement, the first anti-al Qaeda in Iraq movement established in the country.\n\nMore than 25,000 U.S. troops serve in the sprawling Anbar province west of Baghdad; most of them Marines. They will remain for the time being but will shift their mission to supporting Iraqi forces, when needed\n\nThe transfer is a \"major progress\" for all of Iraq, said Brigadier Gen. David Perkins, the spokesman for the Multi-National Force in Iraq.\n\nThe transfer ceremony took place in Ramadi, the capital of the western province, and was attended by Iraqi officials and U.S. military brass.

The man claimed that he had not been informed that it would be used for a mosque and had fought the sale in court, before ultimately losing his civil case recently allowing construction to go forward.\n\n\"We can just wait for the next rain or snowfall to cleanse the ground, so we do not fear from this side anything,\" said Illi.\n\n\"But on the other hand it's an emotional thing, it means that there are actually people in this society who deny the right of Muslims when it comes to a mosque in Switzerland and this is something that hurts us.\"",

They all stated the same thing: \"So that you come for another. We will be waiting for you here.\"\n\nThe officers arrested Saturday are on the police force in the city of Arteaga.\n\nMexican President Felipe Calderon, whose home state is Michoacan, responded to the violence by dispatching 1,000 federal police officers to the area. The infusion, which more than tripled the number of federal police officers patrolling Michoacan, angered Michoacan Gov. Leonel Godoy Rangel. He called it an occupation and said he had not been consulted.\n\nAuthorities said Wednesday they were searching for the governor's half-brother, who they say is a top-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana drug cartel. The cartel is blamed for most of the recent violence in the state. The governor's brother, Julio Cesar Godoy Toscano, was elected July 5 to the lower house of Congress.\n\nThe governor has publicly urged his brother to surrender. There were no reports of his apprehension as of late Saturday.\n\nThe sudden spike in violence followed the arrest July 11 of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, described as a high-ranking member of La Familia.\n\nLa Familia members attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda shortly after his arrest, authorities said. When that failed, cartel members attacked federal police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities.\n\nUnder Mexican law, the officers arrested Saturday will be held for 40 days while officials determine whether to formally charge them.",

[This is] believed to be important in the development in the eyes and the brain.\"\n\nIt's now in 95 percent of infant formula sold in the U.S. and in 65 countries around the world, Lockney said.\n\nIt may have been 40 years since NASA put the first man on the moon, but the number of products that use space technology doesn't seem to be diminishing.\n\n\"Spinoff\" publishes articles on 40 to 50 new space-related products every year but receives many more submissions for inclusion.\n\nThe next edition due out in October will feature a new tracking system for endangered animals, including polar bears and whale sharks, which was derived from an algorithm developed for tracking star patterns.\n\n\"Tracing theses animals is something that previously a small core group of scientists would go out and do. We're now able to have ordinary citizens upload their pictures of these animals that have been spotted through Flickr and Facebook. Logging times and dates will significantly increase the level of monitoring of these endangered species,\" Lockney said.\n\nFor more space-related products see NASA's \"Spinoff\" Web site.",

Brady Lum said.\n\nAn aggressive print and online campaign, targeting people ages 18 to 30, will follow, said Kirsten Suto Seckler, who directs the organization's global brand marketing and awareness.\n\nThe ads designed by BBDO New York, will challenge the public -- with language meant to raise eyebrows -- to think about the issue more deeply. The campaign uses slurs against Asians, homosexuals, Jews and African-Americans to make the point that language can be harmful to all groups, including people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nAttention on the Special Olympics skyrocketed Thursday when, in a quick and clearly unscripted moment, President Obama exhibited the power of words during his history-making visit with Jay Leno.  Watch Suzanne Malveaux's look at Obama's Tonight Show appearance »\n\nWhile joking on The Tonight Show about his bowling prowess (during last year's campaign trail he shamefully scored 37 in a game), Obama said he'd been practicing at the White House.\n\nHe told Leno that he bowled 129 in the White House bowling alley and said his bowling skills are \"like Special Olympics or something.\"\n\nThe comment during the taping of the show prompted Obama to pick up the phone on Air Force One and call Special Olympics Chairman Timothy Shriver to preemptively apologize for the remark before it hit television screens. He also reportedly invited Special Olympic athletes to Pennsylvania Avenue to hit the lanes and give him tips or shoot some hoops.\n\nThe president \"expressed his heartfelt and sincere commitment to work with our athletes and make this country a more accepting place for people with special needs,\" Lum, the organization's president, said.\n\nWhat Obama said on The Tonight Show adds to the discussion that's needed to raise awareness and has proven \"an incredibly important and seriously teachable moment,\" Lum said.\n\nFrom playgrounds to the \"top rungs of our leadership, including our president,\" he said Americans have plenty to talk about and learn when it comes to stereotypes and how words can sting.",

    "context": "(CNN) -- An Australian woman is suing the nation's top four banks for their alleged role in laundering money from her teenage son's $200,000 eBay scam that afforded him a $6,000-a-day playboy lifestyle.\n\nAustralian media reported that in 2007, the then 14 year old boy was making so much money selling non-existent laptops, mobile phones and watches on eBay he could afford to book a $4300-a-night penthouses overlooking Sydney Harbour, fly friends interstate for lavish parties and hire limousines to take him to the beach.\n\nA spokesman for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia confirmed to CNN that the woman from the south coast of New South Wales, who along with her son cannot be named for legal reasons, had launched an action in the Supreme Court seeking damages over the scam.\n\nReports said she was seeking an apology from the Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac and NAB for ''unconscionable conduct'' after allegedly allowing her son to open numerous bank accounts with debit cards \"without reasonable scrutiny\".\n\nShe claims the banks ignored her or refused to discuss the matter for privacy reasons when she warned them they had issued accounts that were being used by a minor to bank illegal funds, reports said.\n\n''He was an intelligent boy who worked out how to cheat the system and play it for all it was worth,'' she told Australia's Sun Herald newspaper. ''As his parent and legal guardian, I begged the banks to stop giving him accounts and debit cards but each time I got nowhere because of the Privacy Act.''\n\nShe said her suspicions were aroused four years ago when her son began spending lavishly. She told the Sun-Herald she later uncovered a log book listing thousands of dollars worth of transactions with eBay.\n\nThe boy, now 19, allegedly deceived the Commonwealth Bank into opening an account after fronting up to the bank with a birth certificate and a friend over the age of 18 who claimed to be his guardian, according to reports in Australian media.\n\n''Once he secured that, he was able to accumulate check and Visa debit accounts with many other financial institutions including Westpac, the Bank of Queensland, ANZ, Credit Union Australia and the Hume Building Society,'' the mother was quoted as saying in the Sun-Herald report.\n\nPolice eventually arrested the boy at school after many of the frauds were linked to an IP address attached to a classroom computer.\n\nBy the time of his arrest, the boy was already allegedly working another scam, milking the $1,500 overdraft facility on a series of debit accounts. In the meantime, reports said, the boy lived a playboy lifestyle with shopping sprees for Versace and Prada clothes and Louis Vuitton luggage.\n\n''There I was, a single mum of two, desperately struggling to put food on the table. He, meanwhile, would stroll in after feasting at the latest fancy restaurant of his choice and chuck me leftovers in a plastic tub,'' she told the Sun-Herald\n\nUnderneath the exterior, her son was an ''insecure boy out to impress,'' she told the newspaper. Reports said that during the past four years, she had reluctantly handed her son to the police 15 times.",

    "context": "(CNN) -- Midway Atoll, a small stretch of sand and coral in the middle of the north Pacific, is home to one of the world's largest populations of Laysan albatrosses.\n\nUntil 1993, U.S. Navy aircraft thundered down the runway of the military base on the island, but now ocean going birds nest and embark on their own epic cross-ocean journeys from the overgrown landing strip.\n\nYet the impact of humans and increasing consumer waste from thousands of miles away continues to have a direct effect on the island's wildlife, as photographic artist Chris Jordan discovered when he traveled there in September.\n\nThe American photographed the remains of albatross chicks that had died from consuming plastic waste found in the surrounding oceans. According to the artist, not a single piece of plastic in any of the photographs was moved, placed or altered in any way.\n\nThe nesting babies had been fed the plastic by their parents, who collected what looked to them like food to bring back to their young.\n\nFrom cigarette lighters to bottle caps, the plastic is found in what is now known as the great Pacific garbage patch that stretches across thousands of miles of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFed a diet of human trash, it is thought that every year tens of thousands of albatross chicks die on Midway from starvation, toxicity and choking.\n\nJordan has examined the environmental effects of consumer society in his previous work. Pieces in his \"Running the Numbers\" exhibition, use digitally manipulated drinks cans and plastic waste from the Pacific gyre, respectively, to create copies of Hokusai's \"Behind the Great Wave off Kanagawa\" and Seurat's \"Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\".",

    "context": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- An outraged sheriff in Illinois who refuses to evict \"innocent\" renters from foreclosed homes criticized mortgage companies Thursday and said the law should protect victims of the mortgage meltdown.\n\nCook County, Illinois, Sheriff Thomas J. Dart says too many renters are being evicted for landlords' problems.\n\nSheriff Thomas J. Dart said earlier he is suspending foreclosure evictions in Cook County, which includes the city of Chicago.\n\nThe county had been on track to reach a record number of evictions, many because of mortgage foreclosures.\n\nMany good tenants are suffering because building owners have fallen behind on their mortgage payments, he said Thursday on CNN's \"American Morning.\"\n\n\"These poor people are seeing everything they own put out on the street. ... They've paid their bills, paid them on time. Here we are with a battering ram at the front door going to throw them out. It's gotten insane,\" he said.  Watch Dart slam mortgage companies »\n\nMortgage companies are supposed to identify a building's occupants before asking for an eviction, but sheriff's deputies routinely find that the mortgage companies have not done so, Dart said.\n\n\"This is an example where the banking industry has not done any of the work they should do. It's a piece of paper to them,\" Dart said.\n\n\"These mortgage companies ... don't care who's in the building,\" Dart said Wednesday. \"They simply want their money and don't care who gets hurt along the way.\n\n\"On top of it all, they want taxpayers to fund their investigative work for them. We're not going to do their jobs for them anymore. We're just not going to evict innocent tenants. It stops today.\"\n\nDart said he wants the courts or the state Legislature to establish protections for those most harmed by the mortgage crisis.\n\nIn 1999, Cook County had 12,935 mortgage foreclosure cases; in 2006, 18,916 cases were filed, and last year, 32,269 were filed. This year's total is expected to exceed 43,000.\n\n\"The people we're interacting with are, many times, oblivious to the financial straits their landlord might be in,\" Dart said. \"They are the innocent victims here, and they are the ones all of us must step up and find some way to protect.\"  Watch sheriff announce he won't evict innocent tenants »\n\nThe Illinois Bankers Association opposed the plan, saying that Dart \"was elected to uphold the law and to fulfill the legal duties of his office, which include serving eviction notices.\"\n\nThe association said Dart could be found in contempt of court for ignoring court eviction orders.\n\n\"The reality is that by ignoring the law and his legal responsibilities, he is carrying out 'vigilantism' at the highest level of an elected official,\" it said. \"The Illinois banking industry is working hard to help troubled homeowners in many ways, but Sheriff Dart's declaration of 'martial law' should not be tolerated.\"\n\nDart was undeterred Thursday.\n\n\"I think the outrage on my part with them [is] that they could so cavalierly issue documents and have me throw people out of homes who have done absolutely nothing wrong,\" Dart said. \"They played by all the rules.\n\n\"I told them, 'You send an agent out, you send somebody out that gives me any type of assurance that the appropriate person is in the house, I will fulfill the order.' iReport.com: How hard have foreclosures hit your neighborhood?\n\n\"When you're blindly sending me out to houses where I'm coming across innocent tenant after innocent tenant, I can't keep doing this and have a good conscience about it.\"",

No other shooting was reported in the area.\n\nThe shots were fired from Russian-controlled territory as the motorcade passed, the ministry said.\n\nRussia's Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin denied the gunfire came from its army positions.\n\n\"This is one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of Georgia,\" he told reporters.\n\nAfter the incident, Saakashvili told reporters he would not have taken his Polish counterpart into danger intentionally and that the incident showed \"you are dealing with unpredictable people\" in the disputed area.\n\nKokoity, the South Ossetian president, countered that the Polish and Georgian presidents need to answer questions whether they informed European Union monitors of their trip.\n\nTensions have remained high in the area since fighting between Russian and Georgian troops broke out in August.\n\nGeorgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist territory, on August 7. The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities outside the rebel regions.\n\nThe two sides blamed each other for starting the conflict and have accused each other of a variety of offenses leading up to and during the fighting, including ethnic cleansing.",

Gen. James Mattis, the Marine commander in charge of the corps' units in the Middle East, ordered the charges dismissed last week.\n\n\"Lt. Gen. Mattis determined that administrative measures are the appropriate response for any errors or omissions allegedly committed by McConnell,\" according to a statement from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton in California.\n\nFour Marines from McConnell's unit were charged with murder in connection with the deaths of up to two dozen civilians in Haditha in November 2005. Charges have been dropped against two of them -- one in exchange for his testimony and the other after a hearing officer decided he acted in accord with the rules of engagement.\n\nTwo other officers -- Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani, the battalion commander, and 1st Lt. Andrew Grayson -- also face charges related to their response to the killings.\n\nHaditha, located along the Euphrates River northwest of Baghdad, was the target of several Marine campaigns aimed at rooting out insurgents from 2004 through 2006.\n\nProsecutors accused the Marines of going on a rampage after a roadside bomb killed one of their comrades, 20-year-old Lance Cpl.

They have all failed, and it should be their responsibility to make good for it.\"\n\nGeorgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist Georgian territory, on August 7, 2008. The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another Russian-backed breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities outside the rebel regions.\n\nA total of about 850 people were killed on all sides, the report said, and untold numbers of others were wounded or went missing. About 100,000 civilians fled their homes, and about 35,000 have been unable to return.\n\n\"The fighting did not end the political conflict, nor were any of the issues that lay beneath it resolved,\" the report said. \"Tensions still continue. The political situation after the end of fighting turned out to be no easier and in some respects even more difficult than before.\"\n\nRussia and Georgia each blamed the other for starting the conflict, and accused each other of a variety of offenses leading up to and during the fighting, including ethnic cleansing. Moscow has since recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent regions. But relations between Georgia and Russia are at an \"all-time low,\" the report notes.\n\nAfter five days of fighting, a peace deal was brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, acting on behalf of the EU. An implementation effort followed on September 8. The report noted that the actions \"stood in contrast to the failure of the international community, including the U.N. Security Council, to act swiftly and resolutely enough in order to control the ever-mounting tensions prior (to) the outbreak of armed conflict.\"\n\nGeorgian armed forces shelled the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali the night of August 7. While that action was seen as the start of the armed conflict, \"it was only the culminating point of a long period of increasing tensions, provocations and incidents,\" the fact-finding report said. \"Indeed, the conflict has deep roots in the history of the region, in peoples' national traditions and aspirations as well as in age-old perceptions or rather misperceptions of each other, which were never mended and sometimes exploited.\"\n\nAny evaluation of the conflict should take that into account, along with mounting tensions in the months and weeks leading up to it, the report said, as well as \"years of provocations, mutual accusations, military and political threats and acts of violence both inside and outside the conflict zone.\n\n\"It has to consider, too, the impact of a great power's coercive politics and diplomacy against a small and insubordinate neighbor, together with the small neighbour's penchant for overplaying its hand and acting in the heat of the moment without careful consideration of the final outcome, not to mention its fear that it might permanently lose important parts of its territory through creeping annexation,\" the report said.\n\nThe fact-finding mission was established in December by the EU to investigate the conflict. It was headed by Heidi Tagliavini, a former United Nations special representative for Georgia.\n\nThe EU said in a statement it welcomed the report and hopes its findings can contribute to future international efforts at \"preventive diplomacy.\"",

    "context": "(CNN) -- A Canadian firetruck responding with lights and sirens to a weekend fire in Rouses Point, New York, was stopped at the U.S. border for about eight minutes, U.S. border officials said Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S.-Canadian border is more than 5,000 miles long.\n\nFire officials battling the blaze called for help from fire departments in nearby Quebec, using a longstanding and often-used mutual aid agreement. But the first truck that arrived at the small Rouses Point border crossing was delayed as officials checked documentation of the firefighters and their truck, officials confirmed.\n\nTwo other trucks that arrived at the crossing next were cleared in less than two minutes each, a time that one fire official said was still too long considering the situation.\n\n\"It's embarrassing,\" said Chris Trombley, chief of the Champlain [New York] Volunteer Fire Department and deputy fire coordinator for Clinton County Emergency Services. \"We're calling for help from another country and the first roadblock they hit is at our border.\"\n\nThe Canadian firefighters \"were asked for IDs,\" Trombley said. \"I believe they even ran the license plate on the truck to make sure it was legal.\"\n\nIn the past, firetrucks on emergency calls cleared border checkpoints in 30 seconds or less, Trombley said, although he said identification is sometimes checked upon their return.\n\nA U.S. Customs and Border Protection official said the eight-minute delay at the Rouses Point crossing was caused \"when one of the firefighters' admissibility was brought into question.\" He declined to elaborate, citing immigration and privacy laws.\n\nA government source familiar with the case said one firefighter had a criminal record, raising questions about whether he could enter the United States.\n\nKevin Corsaro of the border protection's Buffalo field office said the agency's primary responsibility is to protect the homeland. He called the event an \"isolated incident\" and said agency officials  were meeting with local fire officials to \"develop a plan to prevent the possibility of any delays.\"\n\nNo one was seriously injured in the fire, but The Anchorage Inn restaurant -- a landmark in the village of Rouses Point -- was destroyed. A firefighter who suffered minor smoke inhalation was treated at the scene, said Michael LeBlanc, chief of the Rouses Point Volunteer Fire Department. The cause of the blaze has not been determined, he said.\n\nTen fire departments, including the Canadian departments, responded to the fire.\n\n\"Would it [quicker passage at the border] have changed the outcome of the fire?\" Trombley asked. \"Would the building have been burned? Of course it would.\" But he said firefighters were getting fatigued fighting the fire and relief was delayed. \"Just the fact that it could happen and it could happen again is what has us worried,\" he said.\n\nClinton County has mutual aid agreements with fire departments in Vermont and Quebec, Trombley said, and the county requests help from Quebec fire departments about 30 times a year. It sends help to Canada a similar number of times, he said.\n\nTrombley and LeBlanc said they planned to meet with authorities on Wednesday to discuss the incident. LeBlanc declined to comment. \"I don't have all the facts and I don't want to mistake what happened,\" he said.\n\n\"We've had a mutual aid system in place since the '50s and I can't remember anything like this happening,\" said Trombley.

High Commissioner for Refugees said on Monday that more than 12,000 people have fled militia attacks over the last few days from Sudan's Darfur region to neighboring Chad, still recovering from a recent attempt by rebels there to topple the government.\n\n\"Most of the new arrivals in Chad had already been displaced in Darfur in recent years. They are really tired of being attacked and having to move,\" said UNHCR's Jorge Holly. \"All the new refugees we talked to said they did not want to go back to Darfur at this point, they wanted to be transferred to a refugee camp in eastern Chad.\"\n\nThis latest influx of refugees in Chad aggravates an already deteriorating security situation across this politically unstable region of Africa.\n\nBefore the latest flight into Chad, the UNHCR and its partner groups \"were taking care of 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 camps in eastern Chad and some 50,000 from Central African Republic in the south of the country.\" Up to 30,000 people in Chad fled the country for Cameroon during the rebel-government fighting.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday that one of its employees was killed in western Darfur last week during fighting. The victim is a 45-year-old Sudanese national and father of six children.\n\nHe was killed in the area of Seleia, one of the three towns where reported government-backed Janjaweed militia attacks on Friday left around 200 people dead.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week deplored the acts, urged all parties to stop hostilities, and said \"all parties must adhere to international humanitarian law, which prohibits military attacks against civilians.\"\n\nThe United Nations says \"more than 200,000 people have been killed and 2.2 million others forced to flee their homes since fighting began in 2003 among government forces, rebel groups and allied militia groups known as the Janjaweed.\"\n\nThe recent fight between Chad's government and rebels is seen as a proxy war over Darfur. Sudan's government believes Chad is supporting rebels in Darfur. Chad's government believes Sudan is supporting the rebels that moved on Chad's capital of N'Djamena. E-mail to a friend",

Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.\n\nBetween March 1994 and October 2005, Alamo transported five girls younger than 18 across state lines for sex, according to the indictment.\n\nThe criminal complaint included accounts from three of the girls, two of whom were 17 when the complaint was filed last year and one who was 14. All three said Alamo sexually abused them.\n\nAlamo, whose real name is Bernie Hoffman, had denied all wrongdoing. In a phone interview last year with CNN, he called the accusations a hoax.\n\n\"They're just trying to make our church look evil ... by saying I'm a pornographer. Saying that I rape little children. ... I love children. I don't abuse them. Never have. Never will.\"\n\nAsked why authorities were searching the property, Alamo compared himself to Christ.\n\n\"Why were they after Jesus,\" he asked. \"It's the same reason. Jesus is living within me.\"\n\nAlamo also has compounds in Oklahoma and New Jersey.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center says Tony Alamo Christian Ministries is anti-Catholic and a cult.",

Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n\nHutchison called Perry to concede the race after returns indicated that the governor was cruising toward a resounding victory in the closely-watched primary.\n\n\"Now we must unite,\" she said. \"We must win Texas for Republicans.\"\n\nPerry's win ended a yearlong intra-party fight that was billed from the start as a clash of Texas political titans but ended with a whimper as Hutchison struggled to fight a tide of anti-Washington sentiment among conservatives.\n\nThe governor cast his victory as a warning shot to Washington in the mold of recent GOP wins in the Virginia and New Jersey governor's races and the Massachusetts special Senate election.\n\n\"I think the message is pretty clear,\" Perry told supporters at his election night party near Austin. \"Conservatism has never been stronger than it is today.\"\n\nPerry said the message to Washington was simple: \"Quit spending all the money,\" he said. \"Stop trying to take over our lives and our businesses.\"\n\nHe added: \"Stop messing with Texas!\"\n\nPerry, the longest serving governor in Texas history, is seeking a third full term in Austin. His opponent in the general election will be Democrat Bill White, the former Houston mayor who dispatched six opponents in the Democratic primary.\n\nWith nearly two-thirds of precincts reporting, Perry maintained a 20-point lead over Hutchison and appeared to be on pace to cross the crucial 50 percent mark needed to avoid a six-week runoff election against the three-term senator, who began her gubernatorial bid as the prohibitive frontrunner but stumbled as Perry's campaign cast her as a big-spending Washington insider.\n\nGOP activist Debra Medina, a conservative with strong support among Tea Party activists, looked to be headed for a third place finish.\n\nWhite, the popular former three-term mayor of Houston, the country's fourth-largest city, predicted that Perry will try to nationalize the race and tie him to unpopular Democratic agenda items in Washington.\n\n\"He'll run against President Obama,\" White said in an interview. \"That's probably for his own political career. I think he wants to run for president. I'm just running for the people of Texas. It shouldn't be about a party or who's doing what to whom in Washington.\"",

Bush refused to see her, and she abandoned her protests in Texas last year.\n\nBryan's odyssey took three months.

But weather delays and running out of gas once delayed her arrival in Texas until this weekend, when Bush happens to be spending time at his ranch.\n\nWhile the odds of landing a meeting with the president are remote at best, Bryan said if she had the chance she would like to start a dialogue of peace based on the conversations she had with Americans along the way.\n\n\"I would say even those who voted for Bush do not support this war,\" she said.\n\nBut the large crowds of antiwar activists that followed Sheehan around Crawford in the summer of 2005 have long since vanished.\n\nA \"rally\" at the Peace House to celebrate Bryan's arrival drew just a handful of antiwar activists. Nevertheless, Bryan said she was not defeated.\n\n\"Calm seas,\" she said, \"don't make good sailors.\" E-mail to a friend",

    "context": "(CNN) -- The House of Representatives voted Friday to impeach a federal judge convicted of obstruction of justice while in office.\n\nJudge Samuel Kent was the first federal judge to be charged with sexual crimes while in office.\n\nU.S. District Judge Samuel B. Kent of Texas pleaded guilty in February, admitting he lied to investigators about nonconsensual sexual contact with two employees in his courthouse. As part of a plea agreement, other counts alleging sexual misconduct were dropped.\n\nKent was the first federal judge to be charged with sexual crimes while in office.\n\nHe has submitted his resignation, but made it effective June 1, 2010, meaning he would be paid for a year while in prison.\n\nThat drew a heated response among some members of Congress, and a House Judiciary Committee task force unanimously approved four articles of impeachment against Kent on the grounds of sexual assault, obstruction of justice and providing false statements to federal investigators.\n\nBefore the House vote, Judiciary Committee member Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, said to House members that Kent collecting a salary of about $174,000 while in prison constituted \"an attempt to extort hundreds of thousands of dollars from the American people.\"\n\nThere were no dissenting votes.\n\nThe decision on whether to convict Kent will be made by the Senate. A conviction would mean he would lose his seat on the federal bench and his pension.\n\nKent, who turns 60 this month, was sentenced in May to 33 months in prison and began serving the sentence Monday. He was ordered to undergo treatment for alcoholism while in prison.\n\nAn attempt to reach Kent's attorney for comment was unsuccessful Friday afternoon.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush nominated Kent, who took his seat on the bench of the Southern District of Texas on October 1, 1990. Kent is the 14th federal judge to be impeached by the House. The last impeachment -- on charges of lying to a federal grand jury -- was of Mississippi Judge Walter Nixon in 1989.",

His voice is gravelly and you have to be close to hear him, but he is talking.\"\n\nStow, 42, a paramedic from Santa Cruz, California, went into a coma as a result of the March 31 beating after a game between the Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nAccording to the family, when speech therapists asked Stow his first and last name, he responded. A therapist asked what his daughter's name was and Stow said, \"Tabby.\" The therapist asked what that was short for and he correctly said, \"Tabitha.\" Stow was also able to say the name of his son, Tyler, the family said.\n\nThe critically injured man also was able to give his birth date and say he wanted to see Tabitha and Tyler.\n\nDoctors are trying to control Stow's blood clots and keep them from his lungs, his family said.\n\n\"Bryan's had many ups and downs, and though we see how far he has come, we try not to look too far back into these past 6 months, and we can't look too far down the road so we focus on right now,\" his family wrote. \"Bryan is more awake and more responsive then ever.\"\n\nThe men police believe were responsible for his attack -- Marvin Norwood, 30, and Louie Sanchez, 29 -- pleaded not guilty last month to felony charges related to the beating.\n\nIn the parking lot, two men confronted Stow and -- unprovoked -- began kicking and punching him while yelling profanities about the Giants, police have said.

    "context": "STONE MOUNTAIN, Georgia (CNN) -- Rosa Foster sat down at the kitchen table with a plate of fried chicken and a salad. Before taking a bite of food, she bowed her head and prompted her grandchildren to say the blessing.\n\nRosa Foster is a single parent raising four grandchildren under age 19.\n\nFoster, 54, of Stone Mountain, Georgia, doesn't just see the kids on weekends and holidays. They live with her full time.\n\nFoster is one of 2.5 million grandparents around the United States who are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren.\n\nIn Foster's case, she's a single parent, raising four grandkids under age 19. \"It has not been a picnic all the time,\" Foster said. \"It's been hard.\"\n\nHard may be an understatement, according to Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist for Grady Health System in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\"There are many challenges for grandparents taking on grandchildren,\" Kaslow said. \"Many grandparents are older when they take on grandchildren, so you may not have the energy you had as a parent in your 20s and 30s to be running around after toddlers.\"\n\nFoster didn't have a choice. She said she was awarded custody of her daughter's 2-year old son, Rakim, in 1991.\n\nThat was 17 years ago. She's since taken in his twin sisters, Rosea and Ronea, now 17, and 12-year-old Raquel.\n\n\"Some days I became a little sad and depressed and I would cry through baby feedings, but I still knew I had to keep the babies together. They didn't have anybody else,\" Foster recalled.\n\nThe unexpected demands of caring for grandchildren full time may have health consequences, Kaslow said.\n\n\"You often see people having aches and pains or headaches or stomach aches,\" she said. \"It can be associated with more serious physical problems like elevated blood pressure or things that put you at risk for heart disease or stroke.\"  Health Minute: More on grandparent stress »\n\nFoster remembered sleeping only one or two hours a night while she worked two jobs trying to pay the bills.\n\nKaslow said it is common for grandparents to feel the stress of financial demands when they're a parent the second time around.\n\n\"Oftentimes you're at a place in your life where you're ready to take care of yourself, have more fun, plan for your own retirement,\" Kaslow noted. \"Monies you were trying to save for your own future, you are now having to spend on your grandchildren.\"\n\nShe suggested that grandparents set priorities when it comes to their own career and work. While resources may be limited, she recommended trying to find financial help from state agencies, religious groups or other relatives.\n\nFor those who may feel overwhelmed, she added, \"You don't need to be the sole caregiver. It's really important for you to reach out to other people in your support network, your immediate family, to get their assistance.\"\n\nShe also stressed the need for grandparents to take good care of themselves. Find time to exercise and eat a healthy diet.\n\n\"I recommend if you can, get someone to baby-sit the kids once a week or every other week,\" she said. \"You really need time alone.\"\n\nDoes Foster ever get time for herself?\n\nShe chuckled, explaining that she has put her own life on hold for 17 years. But, she added, \"I wouldn't have it any other way.\"\n\nFoster has some serious advice for other grandparents who may be in a similar position: \"Make sure you're up for the challenge, because if you're not, you're going to break some kids' hearts. If those kids are torn up a second time, they're really going to be destroyed.\"",

    "context": "(CNN) -- Thousands of protesters in cities across the United States waved American flags as they rallied Saturday against Arizona's tough new immigration law and pushed for national immigration reform.\n\n\"Si se puede,\" \"Yes we can\" and \"Boycott Arizona\" were common refrains for groups protesting from Los Angeles, California, to New York City.\n\nMay 1 is traditionally a rallying day for supporters of immigration reform. But protesters across the country said they were galvanized by Arizona's recent passage of a law cracking down on illegal immigration.\n\nThe new Arizona law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they are in the United States illegally. Critics say it will lead to discrimination and racial profiling.\n\nBut Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has said the law is necessary because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with Mexico, allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to move into the state. She said changes to the law she approved Friday, which clarify that police could only stop suspected illegal immigrants while enforcing some other law or ordinance, should eliminate concerns about racial profiling.\n\nBut criticism of the law was clear among tens of thousands of protesters flooding the streets of Los Angeles on Saturday, where organizers said they hoped to send a strong message with the number of people turning out.\n\n\"Does my face look illegal?\" one sign read.\n\nKaren Rayner, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department, said 50,000 people marched at the demonstration's peak. Rayner said the rally was \"very peaceful\" and no one was arrested.\n\nPolice arrested about 20 protesters -- including a U.S. congressman -- at Saturday's rally in Washington.\n\nRep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, was among a group of protesters who were arrested for blocking the sidewalk outside the White House in what they said was a planned act of civil disobedience. The protesters wore T-shirts that read \"ARREST ME NOT MY FAMILY\" and \"ARREST ME NOT MY FRIENDS.\"\n\nA smaller group of about 200 people rallied outside the State Capitol in Phoenix, protesting the new law and asking the federal government to step in to stop it.\n\nAbout 1,000 people gathered in New York City's Union Square on Saturday afternoon.\n\nCesar Mack, an international studies student at City College of New York, told CNN he was an undocumented immigrant from Peru.\n\n\"I've been living in this country six years and I'm still fighting for immigration reform,\" he said.\n\nCNN iReporter Julio Ortiz-Teissonniere said he saw signs in Arabic, French, Spanish and English at the New York rally. One sign in the crowd particularly caught his eye: \"Todos somos Arizona\" -- \"We are all Arizona.\"\n\n\"They were trying to convey that message that it's a city and nation based on immigration. Everybody came from somewhere else,\" he said.\n\nCNN's Susan Candiotti, Ted Rowlands, Ione Molinares and Casey Wian contributed to this report.",

    "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The romantic comedy \"New In Town\" puts co-stars Renee Zellweger and Harry Connick Jr. at odds through most of the film. But behind the camera, the story was completely different, the pair told CNN.\n\nHarry Connick Jr. and Renee Zellweger enjoyed working with one another on the set of \"New In Town.\"\n\n\"I had a great time. [Connick is] such a nice guy. He shows up on set and makes everyone laugh, and it's just a nice day at work,\" Zellweger said.\n\nConnick agreed, saying the off-camera friendship with his co-star made the on-camera experience an enjoyable one.\n\n\"Renee is the type of person that I got to know quickly. Well, I became friends with her quickly. She's a very mysterious, wonderful young lady,\" Connick said.\n\nDirected by Jonas Elmer, the film follows Zellweger as Lucy Hill, a Miami, Florida-based corporate shark who travels to a small Minnesota town to oversee the closing of a small factory. Upon arrival, Lucy clashes with the factory's union representative, Ted Mitchell, played by Connick. As the two begin to understand one another, their icy relationship soon melts into romance.\n\nBut the romance between Lucy and Ted is only one side of the story. Zellweger said she was instantly drawn to the role for its humor.\n\n\"I loved the physical comedy part of Lucy Hill's experience. I laughed out loud when I imagined the scenarios, and I could not wait to go and play around with that,\" she said, \"I wanted to go to work every day and laugh, and I did.\"\n\nFamous for her roles in such comedies as \"Nurse Betty\" and \"Bridget Jones's Diary,\" Zellweger is no stranger to the comedic scene. With \"New In Town,\" the actress was eager to once again play a part that would make audiences laugh.\n\n\"I think the laughter, that's therapeutic,\" she said.\n\nAt a time when the country is struggling through a financial recession, Connick said, \"New In Town\" provides that necessary therapy. While the film centers on the troubles of one rural American town, it showcases a dilemma familiar to the entire country.\n\n\"I think there's a good balance of what people are really feeling right now, and you walk away from this movie with a real feeling of hope and like, 'We're going to be all right,'\" he said.\n\n\"New In Town\" opens in theaters everywhere this Friday.\n\nCNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this story.",

The attack sparked a riot by immigrants who complained about \"racism\" but officials suspect a dispute over drug trafficking.\n\nThose arrested, Alessandro Cirillo, Oreste Spagnuolo and Giovanni Letizia, were on the list of the 100 most dangerous men and wanted criminals in Italy.\n\nThe arrests were part of a large police operation aimed at cracking down on organized crime in the Campania region and in particular the powerful Casalesi clan belonging to the Neapolitan mafia known as Camorra.\n\nThe Casalesi clan and the area where the arrests took place prominently featured in the best seller \"Gomorrah,\" a book written by Roberto Saviano who now lives under constant police protection.\n\n\"This is a great day for the Italian state,\" said Carmelo Casabona, head of the police in Caserta. \"The operation was an immediate, concrete and strong answer to organized crime in this region.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Italian interior minister announced the deployment of 400 additional police officers in the area.

    "context": "(CNN)  -- Biologist Matt Aresco has been carrying a big burden for years.\n\nA biologist says that wherever he can get it, he'll take money to protect turtles from a killer stretch of road.\n\nHe's made it his mission to save thousands of turtles from near-certain death on one of the worst turtle-killing highways in America, U.S. Route 27 just north of Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nThe road skirts Lake Jackson, but that didn't stop the turtles from wanting to get to the other side. In three years, Aresco counted nearly 9,000 dead turtles.\n\n\"There were days when I would find 200 turtles attempting to cross,\" he told CNN. \"It was unreal.\"\n\nBut what sounds unreal to some in Washington is the solution to the turtle trouble: $3.4 million in federal stimulus money to build a series of walls and tunnels under the highway so the turtles and other creatures don't have to take on the cars and trucks roaring overhead.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, highlighted the turtle crossing in a blistering report on what he called the 100 worst projects in the stimulus bill.\n\n\"They are wasteful projects, and most of us don't want to steal money from our grandkids to do something that's really stupid right now,\" he said.\n\nMembers of the turtle contingent in Florida were less than thrilled to be singled out.\n\n\"You've got 30- to 40-pound box turtles as big as a manhole cover, and 12-foot alligators,\" said Leon County Commissioner Cliff Thaell. \"Now if Sen. Coburn was to drive his SUV speeding down Highway 27 [at] 60 miles per hour tonight and met one of those fellows, he would have an unpleasant encounter.\"\n\nBut according to the White House, the stimulus money is all about jobs, not turtles. Thaell said he expected \"dozens\" of jobs to be created in the construction of the tunnels, but he could not be precise.\n\nThe jobs that will last only as long as it takes to build the tunnels, and Aresco says he'd rather get the money to help the turtles from other sources. But after years watching the creatures die, and trying to slow the carnage with makeshift fences, he says he'll take the money wherever he can get it.",

Iran's presidential election will take place on June 12.\n\nThe attack happened in Sistan-Balochistan province in southeastern Iran, the same province where a Shia mosque was bombed Thursday. Several suspects have been arrested in connection with Thursday's attack in the town of Zahedan, which killed between 15 and 20 people, according to Iranian media reports.\n\nNo group publicly accepted responsibility for the mosque attack, but the provincial governor, Ali-Mohammad Azad, blamed a terrorist group that he said would be unveiled to the public once the suspects have been interrogated, IRNA reported.\n\nZahedan is about 1,100 km (700 miles) southeast of Tehran, near Iran's borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nSistan-Balochistan province -- which shares a border with Pakistan -- is the site of frequent clashes involving Iranian police, drug dealers and armed groups. The province is located on a major narcotics-smuggling route between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nAzad said information on the arrested terrorist group would be unveiled to the public once interrogations were complete.\n\n\"The terrorists and notorious gang planned to stir order and security in the province on the eve of (the June 12 presidential) elections, using ongoing insecurity in our eastern neighbors,\" he said Thursday.\n\nSeveral days of mourning were reported to be under way for victims of the explosion.\n\nAyatollah Ahmad Khatami, a hard-line cleric who led Friday prayers in Tehran, said there were signs that the United States and Israel were involved in the mosque bombing, IRNA reported.

Some 35,000 people had fled to evacuation centers, the official Philippines News Agency reported, citing the Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council.\n\nThe worst-hit areas included Bayambang, Alcala and Basista, the news agency reported.\n\nPeople clambered onto rooftops as floodwaters rose, calling and texting for help. Rescue trucks were hampered by floodwaters that reach the roofs of single-story houses, Baraan said. About 16 rubber rescue boats had been deployed.\n\nSince the rains started in central Luzon, three dams in the Pangasinan area have been releasing vast amounts of water -- up to 10 million cubic meters per hour at one dam, dam officials said.\n\nWater passing through the three dams -- the Ambuklao, the Binga and the San Roque -- is rushing into the Agno River, which has been swollen since Thursday and affects seven towns in eastern Pangasinan, dam officials said.\n\nWater released from the San Roque dam has contributed to the flooding in eastern Pangasinan, acknowledged Alex Palada, division manager for flood forecasting and warning of the National Power Corporation. Dam officials had no choice but to maintain safe water levels, he added, noting that he alerted Pangasinan Governor Amado Espino. The governor started to evacuate residents Thursday when the Agno River started to rise, Palada said.\n\nIn the last several days, water has become the Philippines' biggest enemy, as Parma, locally known as \"Pepeng,\" dumped as much as 36 inches (91.4 centimeters) of rain in some parts of the nation of islands, compounding misery in areas already flooded by earlier storm Ketsana.\n\nParma was forecast to have winds of no greater than 39 mph (63 kph) by Friday.\n\nThe U.S. Navy was expected to join rescue operations in Pangasinan, according to the agency.\n\nJournalist Lilibeth Frondoso and CNN's Judy Kwon contributed to this report.",

But should Lambert even be on the show, since he has performed professionally in the national Broadway tour of \"Wicked\"?\n\nFormer 'American Idol' runner-up Diana DeGarmo says it's getting harder for the average person to get on the show.\n\nDiana DeGarmo, runner-up in the third season of \"American Idol,\" spoke with HLN's Mike Galanos on Prime News about whether or not an amateur stands a chance on the show.\n\nThe following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nMike Galanos: What were the stipulations as to your past history before you joined \"American Idol\"? How much could you do before they'd say, \"You aren't an amateur anymore. You're more of a professional\"?\n\nDiana DeGarmo: Each contract for each show has gotten a little stronger and a little stronger. Prior to me doing \"American Idol,\" I had done things like theater, but at that point nowhere near on a professional level.\n\nThe cool thing is they keep it fair by having little things in the contract about how you can't release a record nationally with a record label -- things like that. But people who have been signed prior can, of course, be on the show.\n\nGalanos: Do you think the \"rags-to-riches\" story is lost and we are going to get more and more people who have more and more experience?\n\nDeGarmo: I think people now realize that \"American Idol\" is such a launching spot for anyone's career. People that maybe would have not done it a few years ago, saying, \"Oh, I'm too professional,\" maybe take a little bit of a second glance at the show because they realize it's such a launching pad. But I do think it's a little harder for the everyday Joe to get in it.\n\nGalanos: Do you think Adam has an unfair advantage since he was an understudy for the Broadway tour of \"Wicked\"?\n\nDeGarmo: Not really, because it's all about performing. So it's just about what you are doing at that exact moment up there on the \"American Idol\" stage. I think Kris and Adam are just two totally different performers, but I think they are pretty even when it comes down to the end of the day.",

    "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- If your organization has the right stuff, it could display one of the U.S. shuttles that NASA plans to retire from service in 2010.\n\nSpace Shuttle Endeavour comes in for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California last month.\n\nThe space agency sent a notice this week to museums, schools and similar institutions to gauge their interest and qualifications for properly housing Discovery, Atlantis or Endeavour.\n\nThe shuttles are to be retired by September 30, 2010, but they won't be available until about a year later, NASA spokesman Michael Curie said Thursday.\n\n\"These are national assets, national treasures and something that NASA feels the public would want to see displayed publicly for years to come,\" Curie said.\n\nSpace shuttle Discovery already has been offered to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington.\n\n\"We have the information, and of course, we're thrilled to be considered for this artifact,\" said Claire Brown, director of communications for the museum. But no action has been taken at this point, and the institution doesn't have a plan for incurring the cost, she added.\n\nThe privilege of showing off a shuttle won't be cheap -- about $42 million.\n\nThis figure will include $28.2 million for the removal of hazardous chemicals -- such as ammonia, used as a coolant, and nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine, used as fuel; $5.8 million for moving the shuttle via a carrier aircraft to its new location; and $8 million for preparing the shuttle for display, Curie said.\n\nA carrier aircraft will be the only way to deliver a shuttle to a landlocked location, and such aircraft will no longer be in NASA's budget once the shuttle program ends.\n\nAfter chemicals are drained from the shuttle, its estimated weight will be about 170,000 pounds, Curie said.\n\nWhatever facility receives a shuttle must have experience in displaying space hardware and major historical artifacts, NASA said. The shuttles will be released without their engines, which, along with other components, will be offered separately. The deadline for responding to NASA is March 17.\n\nNASA emphasizes that it will pay special attention to ensuring that the shuttles will retire to \"appropriate places.\" The agency wants them to remain in the United States, and private collectors likely would not meet NASA's goal to have the orbiters and engines displayed publicly, Curie said.\n\n\"We really feel that these are artifacts that are important to the history of the country and that as many people as possible should have the opportunity to see them if they can,\" Curie said.\n\nAsked whether NASA had considered trying to sell the shuttles on eBay, he laughed: \"No, that probably wouldn't be the prudent thing to do with something paid for by taxpayers' money.\"\n\nIn January 2004, President Bush called for an eventual shift in focus from the space shuttle program to the new Vision for Space Exploration program, which NASA describes as \"a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system.\"\n\nBush has said he wants astronauts to return to the moon by 2020. However, President-elect Barack Obama has a team reviewing options for the direction of space exploration.\n\nCNN's A. Pawlowski contributed to this report.",

    "context": "(CNN) -- The wife of missing adventurer Steve Fossett has asked a court to declare him dead.\n\nSteve Fossett and wife Peggy in a February 2006 photograph.\n\nFossett was last seen in early September, flying a single-engine plane on a pleasure flight from a Nevada ranch. A month-long search for the plane was unsuccessful.\n\n\"As difficult as it is for me to reach this conclusion, I no longer hold out any hope that Steve has survived,\" wrote Peggy V. Fossett in court documents filed Monday with the Cook County [Illinois] Circuit Court.\n\nShe asked that the will of her husband of 38 years be admitted to probate.\n\nAt about 8:45 a.m. on September 3, the millionaire took off on what he said was to be a solo pleasure flight over the Sierra Nevada mountain range.\n\nHe had planned to fly over the Nevada desert for two to three hours, and was expecting to return for lunch to the Nevada ranch, from which he departed. He was carrying a single bottle of water and had no parachute, lawyers for Mrs. Fossett said in the court documents.\n\nAt 3 p.m., when he had not returned, a search began that ultimately included thousands of volunteers. It continued until October 2.\n\n\"No one involved in the search holds out any hope that Fossett is still alive,\" the petition said.\n\nRick Rains, a sheriff's supervisor of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, said Fossett's plane was last spotted at 11 a.m. less than 20 miles from the ranch's airport. \"Given the timeline and the sighting of Fossett's plane, I believe he was within 20 to 25 miles of the ranch when he crashed,\" Rains said.\n\nBut, he noted, \"the terrain is very difficult to search, with many areas where the crevices, deep ravines and closely grown trees make it impossible to see from the air what is on the ground.\"\n\n\"If Fossett was physically able to find water to survive on in the Nevada desert, he would have been physically capable of signaling searchers, by doing something as simple as crafting a large X of sticks or rocks, or by starting a signal fire,\" Rains said.\n\nIn affidavits supporting his wife's petition, Fossett's doctor described the 63-year-old man as physically and mentally fit.\n\nRobert Keilholtz, a captain in the California Civil Air Patrol who was involved in the search, noted that the difficulty in finding wreckage was underscored by the fact that World War II-era plane wreckage was discovered last spring in the mountain range.\n\nIn the search for Fossett, wreckage from eight other crashes was discovered, one of them from the 1960s, the lawyers said.\n\nFossett made his money in the financial services industry, but is renowned for his daredevil exploits, which include nonstop, round-the-world trips aboard a balloon, a fixed-wing plane and a boat.\n\nAt the time of his disappearance, Fossett was working on a project to build a single-man submarine and to build a vehicle capable of breaking land speed records by traveling at up to 800 mph, lawyers for his wife said.

    "context": "(CNN) -- Friday marks the passage of one month since a magnitude-7.0 earthquake devastated Haiti. As thousands of Haitians gathered in the center of Port-au-Prince to remember what was lost that day, Ann Veneman, executive director of UNICEF, spoke to CNN's \"American Morning\" about the situation.\n\n\"We don't know how many actually were orphaned by the earthquake. There are so many children in Haiti without parental supervision who need to be cared for, who need to be fed, clothed and so forth and protected,\" she said.\n\nTracking down the actual numbers in Haiti can be tough given the circumstances.\n\nFact check: One month after the earthquake, what numbers are available to tell the story of devastation and recovery?\n\n• Human toll: The Haitian government says the quake claimed the lives of more than 212,000 people and injured more than 300,000. The U.S. Agency for International Development estimates that 3 million people were affected by the quake and 700,000 in Port-au-Prince were displaced.\n\n• Aid agencies: The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that more than 400 agencies were registered with the Haitian government to do work in Haiti before the quake. Because some of the non-governmental organizations are small and work in remote, rural areas, their presence may not even be known to the Haitian government.\n\n• Aid given: According to the U.N. humanitarian affairs office, more than 2.3 million people have received food aid from the World Food Programme and their partners, and more than 10,300 mosquito nets, 23,000 family tents, 26,500 kitchen sets and 79,500 blankets have been distributed.\n\n• Sanitation: The World Health Organization estimated this week that less than 5 percent of the need for latrines has been meet. However, there has not been an increase in reported infectious diseases. More than 900,000 people have access to safe drinking water, but that still falls short of the goal of providing water to 1.1 million.\n\n• Children: About 5,000 schools were destroyed or damaged in the quake. According to the U.N. humanitarian affairs office, the Haitian government aims to have all schools open again before the end of March.\n\nKathleen Strottman, executive director of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, estimates that there were more than 900 orphans in the process of being adopted into American homes when the quake struck.\n\nBottom line: One month after the most devastating earthquake in Haiti's history, the available numbers show a nation with great needs. However, the numbers also show that aid is reaching a large percentage of the people.\n\nGot something that needs checking?

Check back for updates on his trip.\n\nCNN.com's Jarrett Bellini tours vineyards outside Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa (CNN) -- I'm not a wine drinker.\n\nBefore today's excursion, in fact, I could only tell you that on the face of the planet there existed three types of wine: red, white and Carlo Rossi.  The reds are good with meat.  The whites go with fish.  And, according to what I learned from my dad, Carlo Rossi goes with a glass of ice.\n\nSo, exploring South Africa's wine country, just a short drive from Cape Town, seemed like a perfect educational way for me to spend my day.  I mean, it was that or go to a museum.\n\nOur guide, Jack, was amazingly knowledgeable about the subject, but without being a pretentious jerk.  Really, as far as he is concerned, the best wine in the world is whatever wine you enjoy.  I didn't ask, but was curious if that applied to Boone's Farm?\n\nThroughout the day, we hit four wineries, tasting 23 bottles in all.  I know because I kept hash marks on my hand.  I'm pretty classy.\n\nNow, despite the outstanding info we received from our guide as we sipped and swirled and spat, I can't say that I'm any better at understanding the finer points of wine than I was this morning when I woke up.  However, I did manage to get a solid buzz.  And that should be worth something.\n\nEven without the wine, a visit to South Africa's vineyards is a great addition to a traveler's to-do list. It's not far from the city and the scenery is beautiful. If you need an added incentive, there are even a few cheese farms in the area where you can really crank the whole experience up to 11.\n\nI personally thanked one of the goats for his contribution. He didn't seem to care. He also didn't seem physically capable of producing anything that might actually turn into cheese. But I thanked him anyway.\n\nWhat can I say? I'm not a wine drinker.",

    "context": "NORTH ATTLEBOROUGH, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Ron Hassell stares at one really worn-out brown leather loafer.\n\nRon Hassell has seen his share of heels. And soles. His grandfather taught him the shoe-repair trade.\n\n\"This is a shoe I don't want to tackle,\" he grimaces as his finger traces holes on the bottom. \"I tried to talk the guy out of fixing it, believe it or not.\"\n\nThe cobbler grabs a tool to rip off the entire sole. \"Some guys get a favorite pair of shoes. ... as you can tell, this guy wore this one to death.\"\n\nHe brings one of the shoes to a grinder that files down the last of the old sole and heel. \"It'll look brand new when I'm done,\" Hassell says.\n\nHassell's shoe repair business, tucked into the corner of a three-story building in downtown North Attleborough, Massachusetts, is a trade and a tradition.\n\nThe shop he now owns, North Shoe Repair, once belonged to his grandfather, who taught him everything he knows about being a cobbler.\n\n\"He was one of the best,\" Ron says, and he knows this because that's what all the salesmen -- the ones who sold products to all the local shoe repair shops -- would tell him.\n\nThere are not a lot of cobblers left in the area, but Hassell's business has been steady and has even picked up in the last year. He sees the economy as one reason. It's far more economical to spend $12.50 on a pair of $125 shoes than to buy new ones.\n\nHassell, however, sees another reason for being busy. With few young people entering the trade, customers seek out cobblers when theirs retire.\n\n\"I used to be the youngest that I knew of, because I started when I was twenty. Of course I'm close to fifty now, and I'm still probably one of the youngest around here.\"  Watch the craftsman at work »\n\nHe continues to work on the really beat-up pair he didn't want to face. He uses special cutting and sewing machines to attach new leather to the bottom. Glue is pasted onto parts and the grinding machine is visited several times, both to sand off rough edges and later to polish them to a shine. He'll go back and forth to the various shoes that have been brought in and stop to wait on people bringing in his next challenge to repair.\n\nHis customers seem satisfied with the results they get, and some have been loyal to his business for years.\n\n\"I came when his grandfather was here,\" says Inez Cavallaro, who had come to the shop to pick up a pair of sandals Hassell had fixed. \"I hope he always stays here, because he's great.\n\n\"He has done some magical things for me.\"\n\nThe comments don't go unnoticed by Hassell. \"You know, what's pretty cool is, customers, they get pretty happy. You get that all the time, and it makes you feel good.\"\n\nUsing an old shoe brush to polish what had started the day as a hopeless pair of old shoes, Hassell puts the final touches on what now look like shoes just bought from a store.\n\n\"Better than I thought they were going to come out,\" he says, looking them over one last time.\n\nHassell says he enjoys his craft because he knows what he does is appreciated. As one customer leaves his shop and says goodbye, she stops in the door and turns around. She looks back at Hassell and says, \"Don't go out of business, now!\"\n\nAs long as he can, that's something Ron Hassell has no intention of doing.",

    "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two Supreme Court justices engaged in a late-night exchange of harsh words before the execution early Wednesday of a convicted Tennessee killer who had been sitting on death row for nearly three decades.\n\nJustices John Paul Stevens and Clarence Thomas disagreed over whether to grant a stay of execution for Cecil Johnson Jr.\n\nThe stay eventually was denied, and about an hour later, at 2:34 a.m., Johnson was put to death by lethal injection at a Nashville, Tennessee, prison.\n\nThe 53-year-old inmate had been convicted of murder in a 1980 shooting spree at a convenience store near the state capital. The victims included 12-year-old Bobby Bell Jr., son of the store owner, who was wounded. Two other men sitting in a nearby taxicab also were shot to death.\n\nStevens, who was initially presented the last-minute appeal by Johnson's lawyers, would have granted the stay, along with Justice Stephen Breyer. Stevens was concerned that too much time had elapsed between sentencing and the planned execution, amounting perhaps to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n\"Johnson bears little, if any, responsibility for this delay,\" said Stevens, who said procedural hurdles at the appellate stage for capital defendants created what he called \"underlying evils of intolerable delay.\"\n\n\"The delay itself subjects death row inmates to decades of especially severe, dehumanizing conditions of confinement.\"\n\nIt is an issue that the 89-year-old justice has long urged his colleagues to address, with little success.\n\nIn his early years on the high court in the mid-1970s he had supported the resumption of the death penalty after a four-year moratorium imposed by the Supreme Court. But in recent years, he has voiced his opposition to capital punishment, particularly in cases involving inmates asserting their right to challenge their sentences.\n\nThomas reacted strongly to Stevens' statement. The conservative jurist said the inmate had challenged his conviction and sentence for nearly 29 years and \"now contends that the very proceedings he used to contest his sentence should prohibit the state from carrying it out.\"\n\n\"In Justice Stevens' view, it seems the state can never get the timing just right. The reason, he has said, is that the death penalty itself is wrong.\" Thomas said. \"As long as our system affords capital defendants the procedural safeguards this court has long endorsed, defendants who avail themselves of these procedures will face the delays Justice Stevens laments.\"\n\nThen Thomas goes on to say there are \"alternatives,\" citing the custom in England centuries ago to carry out an execution the day after a conviction.\n\n\"I have no doubt that such a system would avoid the diminishing justification problem Justice Stevens identifies, but I am equally confident it would find little support from this court.\"\n\nThe high court had been presented with Johnson's emergency appeal early Tuesday afternoon, but apparently the time needed to produce the Stevens and Thomas statements delayed the high court from issuing its denial of a stay until 1:38 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nThe execution was carried out as scheduled, with no problems reported by corrections officials.",

    "context": "(CNN) -- Around 200 new species of frogs have been found in Madagascar, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots.\n\nA study has found nearly 200 new species of frogs in Madagascar.\n\nA study identified between 129 and 221 new species of frogs on the island. The Spanish Scientific Research Council (CSIC), who carried out the study, believe the find could practically double the number of amphibians known in the world if the results are extrapolated at a global scale.\n\nThe study, published in the journal \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA,\" suggests that the number of amphibian species in Madagascar has been significantly underestimated.\n\n\"The diversity of species in Madagascar is far from being known and there is still a lot of scientific research to be done. Our data suggest that the number of new species of amphibians not only has been underestimated but it is spatially widespread, even in well studied areas,\" said Professor David R. Vieites, CSIC researcher to the press at the Spanish National Natural Sciences Museum in Madrid.\n\n\"For example, two of the most visited and studied national parks, Ranomafana and Mantadía/Analamazaotra, harbor 31 and 10 new species respectively.\"\n\nDr. Frank Glaw, curator of herpetology at the Zoologische Staatssammlung from Munich was part of the research team: \"During the past 15 years, we discovered and described over 100 new frog species from Madagascar, which led us to believe that our species inventory is almost complete. But as our new surveys show, there are many more species than we suspected,\" he said in a press statement.\n\nThe paper suggests that the total biodiversity on the island could be much higher in other species as well, so the actual destruction of natural habitats may be affecting more animals than previously thought.\n\nThis has important consequences for conservation planning, as the rate of destruction of rainforests in Madagascar has been one of the highest in the planet, with more than 80 percent of the historic surface of rainforest already lost, according to the study's authors.\n\nAlmost a quarter of the new species discovered have not been found yet in protected areas, but the unstable political situation in Madagascar has also been cited as hampering conservation efforts.\n\n\"Although a lot of reserves and national parks have been created in Madagascar during the last decade, the actual situation of politic instability is allowing the cut of the forest within national parks, generating a lot of uncertainty about the future of the planned network of protected areas\", said Vieites.\n\nMadagascar is the fourth largest island in the world and one of the most biodiverse areas globally, with a high degree of endemic species. \"To get an idea of its biodiversity --while in the Iberian Peninsula [there] are about 30 species of amphibians and in Germany about 20, in a single locality in Madagascar we can find around 100 species of frogs,\" said Vieites.\n\nDr. Miguel Vences, professor at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, who was also part of the study team, and believes that a century of new species discovery is just beginning: \"People think that we know which plant and animal species live on this planet. But the majority of life forms on Earth is still awaiting scientific recognition.\"",

But Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has tempered the thawing of relations by saying that Washington remains concerned with Syria's close ties to Iran.\n\n\"No one has enlightened her to comment on regional issues,\" Ahmadinejad said, slamming Clinton's statements as interfering. \"The whole U.S. government has no impact whatsoever on regional relations.\"\n\nTensions between Washington and Tehran have risen over Iran's nuclear program, which Iran insists is intended for civilian use but the United States believes is intended for developing weapons.\n\nAssad voiced strong support for Iran and brushed off U.S. sentiment.\n\n\"I find it strange how they talk about Middle East stability and at the same time talk about dividing two countries,\" he said.\n\nThe meeting between Assad and Ahmadinejad sparked a harsh reaction from Israeli President Shimon Peres.\n\n\"The time has come to speak the truth,\" he said in a written statement. \"The problem in the Middle East is not the Palestinians. The Palestinian problem will be resolved through the peace process in Israel. The central problem in the Middle East is Iran's attempt to reach hegemony over the Arab lands.\"\n\n\"The source of the problem is Ahmadinejad's megalomania. Assad must choose what he wants -- to join the Iranian camp of evil and terror or to make peace with Israel,\" he said.\n\nHe called on Assad to sit down with Israel to reach a peace agreement.",

    "context": "(CNN) -- Japan's 77-year-old emperor is currently in hospital, several days after coming down with a fever, a spokesperson with the Imperial Household Agency says.\n\nEmperor Akihito, a ceremonial but revered figure in the Japan, was suffering from a worsening case of bronchitis and the fever he contracted Thursday, according to the spokesperson, who declined to be identified due to the agency's media protocol.\n\n\"He appears to be fatigued and has lost some resistance to fight against sickness,\" the spokesperson said. \"To be on the safe side, he was hospitalized (Sunday night) at University of Tokyo Hospital.\"\n\nIt is the emperor's second time in a hospital this year, after getting medical treatment in February for extensive tests of his coronary arteries.\n\nIn recent years some analysts believe Akihito's health has been affected by stress. The issues of no male heir for Crown Prince Naruhito, the continued talk of constitutional changes for females to rule and family rifts over the role of the Imperial Household Agency were speculated to be the cause.\n\nTsugunomiya Akihito was born on December 23, 1933 in Tokyo to Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako Kuniat as their fifth child and first son.\n\nAccording to Japanese legend, he is a direct descendant of Japan's first emperor Jimmu, circa 660 BC. Akihito means \"shining pinnacle of virtue,\" and Tsugunomiya means \"prince of the august succession and enlightened benevolence.\"\n\nAt about the age of five, Akihito was separated from his parents, in accordance with Japanese custom at the time, and raised and educated by chamberlains and tutors.\n\nHis youth was packed with events so dramatic that they today seem unimaginable, including Japan's brutal military invasion of China, its foray into World War II and subsequent defeat followed by an unprecedented foreign occupation.\n\nAkihito's post WWII private tutor was an American Quaker, Elizabeth Gray-Vining from Philadelphia, who also happened to be the only foreign guest at his wedding. Married to Michiko Shoda in 1959, he was the first Japanese crown prince to marry a commoner (they met playing tennis), despite the fact there was a designated list of about 800 potential candidates.\n\nThe marriage produced three children; Hiro no miya Naruhito Shinno, Crown Prince Naruhito (born February 23, 1960), Akishino no miya Fumihito Shinno, Prince Akishino (born November 30, 1965), and Nori no miya Sayako Naishinno, Princess Sayako (born April 8, 1969).\n\nOn November 12, 1990, Akihito ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne -- the oldest hereditary monarchy in the world -- as the 125th Emperor of Japan, one year and ten months after the death of Emperor Hirohito.\n\nThe position, per Japan's constitution, is defined as \"the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people.\" That said, the office's involvement in day-to-day government affairs tends to be minimal.\n\nAkihito broke from precedent following Japan's epic 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami earlier this year, when he gave a historic, televised speech on March 16. In it, he encouraged citizens to put forth their \"best effort to save all suffering people\" and he applauded his countrymen's handling of the crisis.\n\n\"I truly hope the victims of the disaster never give up hope, take care of themselves, and live strong for tomorrow,\" he said in a calm and poignant oration delivered from the Imperial Palace. \"Also, I want all citizens of Japan to remember everyone who has been affected by the devastation, not only today but for a long time afterwards -- and help with the recovery.\"\n\nCNN Library contributed to this report.",

    "context": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwean lawmakers on Monday narrowly voted for Lovemore Moyo as speaker of the parliament -- making him the first opposition lawmaker to hold the position in the country's history.\n\nMorgan Tsvangirai's MDC faction has a slim majority following parliamentary elections.\n\n\"This is historic as it ceases to be a rubber-stamping house,\" Moyo said after winning the position. \"It will ensure that progressive laws are passed. I promise to be professional.\"\n\nMoyo -- the national chairman of the main Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party -- received 110 votes while his only opponent, Paul Themba-Nyathi, received 98 votes. The speaker of the parliament is the fourth most powerful post in Zimbabwe.\n\nThemba-Nyathi represented the splinter MDC faction led by Arthur Mutambara, but he had support of President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party.\n\nThe vote took place hours after Mugabe swore in lawmakers, five months after they were elected.\n\nTwo members of the main MDC -- led by presidential candidate Morgan Tsvangirai -- were arrested as they arrived at the opening session, but they were released after a short time, according to a government spokesman.\n\nAn MDC official said the arrests were part of the \"sinister agenda of this regime\" to \"tilt the balance of numbers in their favour during the voting for the speaker of parliament.\"\n\nOne of those detained -- Shuwa Mudiwa -- appeared back in parliament, but the other member -- Elia Jembere -- was not seen, according to sources.\n\nGovernment spokesman Bright Matonga said Jembere had been accused of rape, but that he has been released from custody.\n\nA third member -- Elton Mangoma -- escaped an arrest attempt when other party members came to his rescue, MDC officials said.\n\nAttendance at the session of parliament is important since the membership is closely divided between the MDC and the Mugabe's ZANU-PF.\n\nThe ruling ZANU-PF party lost its majority in the 210-seat parliament in elections in March, but vote recounts and political violence have delayed the body from convening until now.\n\nFinal results gave 100 seats to an MDC faction led by Morgan Tsvangirai, the party's presidential candidate. President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF got 99 seats. An offshoot of the main MDC party, led by Arthur Mutambara, won 10 seats. An independent candidate won one seat.\n\nTsvangirai, who was locked in a bitter presidential contest with Mugabe, had objected to Mugabe's decision to convene parliament, saying it could \"decapitate\" power-sharing talks that have been on hold for the past two weeks.\n\nStill, Tsvangirai said he would attend the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nMDC party spokesman Nelson Chamisa said all MDC members elected to parliament were expected to attend \"except those few MPs who are still in hiding.\"\n\nCNN's Nkepile Mabuse in Johannesburg, South Africa contributed to this report.",

    "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- If one hardened cockpit door is good, would two barriers be even better?\n\nMany airline pilots believe the answer is \"yes,\" and are hoping to reinvigorate efforts to require so-called \"secondary barriers\" on every commercial plane in the country.\n\nPilots praise the hardened cockpit doors mandated after 9/11, saying they have done as much as anything to protect aircraft from terrorist assaults. But planes remain vulnerable for short periods of time during some flights when pilots go to the lavatory, get meals or, on long flights, change out crews.\n\nCurrently, flight attendants sometimes block the aisle with beverage carts to prevent possible terrorists from rushing the cockpit. But pilots believe the barriers -- relatively inexpensive gates that would be deployed before pilots come out of the cockpit -- would solve that vulnerability.\n\n\"This is an absolute no-brainer,\" Capt. Bob Hesselbein of the Air Line Pilots Association said. \"Of all the things we could do, the most cost-effective thing we could do right now is put the device in.\"\n\nALPA this summer published a position paper calling on the U.S. and Canadian governments to require secondary flight deck barriers on all airliners by January 1, 2010. The barriers would be designed to delay anyone trying to attack the cockpit by at least five seconds, giving pilots time to retreat to the cockpit, ALPA said.\n\nHijackers have attempted to gain access to flight decks on planes overseas four times in the past year, according to ALPA.\n\nThe airline industry has fought efforts to require the barriers, saying airlines should be allowed to decide for themselves if the barriers would improve security. The barriers would not be useful on short hauls where pilots don't ordinarily leave the cockpit, and the airline industry claims other layers of protection are sufficient on longer flights.\n\nHesselbein disagrees.\n\n\"You can never guarantee that you're going to have an armed pilot protecting that cockpit from inside that cockpit. You can never guarantee that you're going to have a federal air marshal, or federal air marshal team, in the cabin to defend that cockpit.\n\n\"But the secondary barrier, once installed, will always be there,\" Hesselbein said.\n\nThe government has classified the number of federal air marshals and armed pilots, but it is widely known that they cover a small percentage of flights in the U.S.\n\nIn a June 2005 report to Congress, the Transportation Security Administration said the barrier \"appears to be a simple solution that offers greater security at a relatively low cost.\"\n\n\"Valuable time is gained in deterring the movement of an unauthorized individual towards the flight deck,\" the report said.\n\nBut the TSA recommended against mandating secondary barriers, citing \"the costs of engineering and installation that would be incurred by the [airlines] to retrofit\" aircraft. \"The economic fragility of the industry due to increasing costs, including persistently rising fuel prices, makes this a decisive recommendation.\"\n\nThe Air Transport Association, which represents the nation's major airlines, said hardened cockpit doors and other measures provide effective security and that mandating other measures should not be done \"in the absence of appropriate risk analysis.\"\n\nRep. Steve Israel, D-New York, said he is again introducing a bill to require barriers on passenger planes.\n\n\"Everybody recognizes the vulnerability,\" he said. \"The airline industry recognizes the vulnerability and thinks that the federal government ought to pay for the secondary barriers. The federal government recognizes the vulnerability and thinks that the airline industry should pay.\n\n\"Meanwhile, for as long as the debate continues, the flying public is less safe.\" E-mail to a friend",

Seven other people, ranging in age from 19 to 50, were also injured.\n\n\"Apparently one or two people were shooting or shooting at each other for reasons unknown when eight people were struck by the gunfire,\" New Orleans police said in a statement. The injuries to those wounded in that incident appeared to be non-life-threatening, authorities said.\n\nPolice were still searching for a suspect or suspects Tuesday. Video from the scene showed evidence markers lying next to Mardi Gras beads on the street and the area cordoned off with crime scene tape as music continued to spill from nearby Bourbon Street bars.\n\n\"I've never seen so many people on Bourbon Street scatter to the sides,\" one woman, who was not identified, told WWL. \"I've never seen that in my life.\"\n\nShe said she saw the shooting, but was \"traumatized\" and unable to run. \"I was so scared,\" she said.\n\nA second shooting took place about 1:45 a.m. on Canal Street, police said. A 19-year-old man was killed and three other people injured.\n\nOfficers heard gunshots while on patrol and saw three males running from the scene, police spokesman Garry Flot said in a statement. After a foot pursuit, two men were apprehended.\n\nOne of the men was questioned and released, but a 24-year-old faces charges of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted first-degree murder, police said.\n\nTwo other shootings took place in different locations later in the morning, Flot said, and a total of three people were injured. WWL said the two other shootings took place about 4 and 5:30 a.m.\n\nCNN's Karan Olson Meilhan, Scott Thompson and Samuel Gardner III contributed to this report.",

    "context": "London, England (CNN) -- The British government has apologized and offered compensation to hundreds of people who suffered the effects of thalidomide, a drug once prescribed to pregnant women that later was linked to major birth defects.\n\nThalidomide sufferers and campaigners hailed the move and said it was long overdue.\n\nBritish doctors prescribed thalidomide for expectant mothers from 1958 to 1962 to control the symptoms of morning sickness. The drug, developed by a German firm, was used internationally as a sedative and hailed because overdose simply caused prolonged sleep, not death.\n\nThalidomide also was combined with other drugs to create medications for asthma, hypertension, and migraine, according to the Thalidomide Trust, which supports victims.\n\nDoctors and scientists began to notice gross limb malformations in infants starting in 1960, and scientists linked it to thalidomide the next year. By then, it had affected babies from Kenya to Peru to Japan, though most of the cases were in Germany, where the drug had been available over the counter.\n\nThere are currently 466 people in the United Kingdom whose mothers took the drug when they were in the womb. Most of them have two or four limbs missing, and some also can't see or hear, according to the trust.\n\nOne of them is Louise Medus-Mansell, who was born in 1962 with no arms or legs.\n\n\"It is a bonus, something that we didn't think would ever happen,\" she told CNN about the government's apology. \"There's a lot of people today that have been waiting for this apology from the government that have had partners die.\"\n\nMedus-Mansell, who recently had a kidney transplant, published an autobiography this year titled \"No Hand to Hold and No Legs to Dance On.\"\n\nHealth Minister Mike O'Brien said the British government is creating a £20 million ($32.5 million) fund over three years to meet the health needs of Thalidomide victims, who are between 45 and 51 years old. The money will be distributed by the Thalidomide Trust, he said, and will help reduce further degeneration of their health as the victims grow older.\n\n\"The government wishes to express its sincere regret and deep sympathy for the injury and suffering endured by all those affected when expectant mothers took the drug thalidomide between 1958 and 1961,\" O'Brien said in the House of Commons.\n\n\"We acknowledge both the physical hardship and the emotional difficulties that have faced both the children affected and their families as a result of this drug, and the challenges that many continue to endure, often on a daily basis.\"\n\nThe problems caused by the drug led the British government to review the marketing, testing, and regulation of drugs, O'Brien said. That included the enactment of the Medicines Act 1968, which introduced more testing for medicines prior to licensing to make sure they meet safety standards.\n\nThe Thalidomide Society, which was created in 1962 by the parents of thalidomide victims, said it welcomed the government's apology.\n\n\"I think it obviously makes a great deal of difference (to the children), but I think also for the parents who had dreadful, dreadful trouble in the very early years to convince people that something had happened and it wasn't their fault,\" said society secretary Vivien Kerr. \"For them, I think, it's something to be very grateful for and it's welcome.\"\n\nCNN's Phil Black and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.",

    "context": "(CNN) -- Scientists say a very rare find of some 20 fossilized pterodactyls has produced the first clear evidence of a controversial theory of evolution.\n\nThis image shows the fossilized skeleton of Darwinopterus which was found in north-east China earlier this year.\n\nThe fossils were found in northeast China earlier this year, embedded in rock dating back 160 million years, and have been called \"Darwinopterus\" after the renowned naturalist Charles Darwin.\n\nThe creature's discovery has astounded scientists because their age puts them within two recognized groups of pterodactyls -- primitive long-tailed forms and advanced short-tail forms -- and they display characteristics of both.\n\nThe combination of features indicates that the primitive pterodactyls evolved relatively quickly, and that certain groups of features changed at the same time.\n\nTraditional evolutionary theory suggests that one feature -- a tail for instance -- would slowly evolve over time.\n\n\"Darwinopterus came as quite a shock to us,\" said David Unwin, from the University of Leicester's School of Museum Studies, which identified the creature, along with researchers from the Geological Institute of Beijing.\n\n\"We had always expected a gap-filler with typically intermediate features such as a moderately elongate tail -- neither long nor short -- but the strange thing about Darwinopterus is that it has a head and neck just like that of advanced pterosaurs, while the rest of the skeleton, including a very long tail, is identical to that of primitive forms,\" he said.\n\nBy comparing the fossil with others from earlier and later periods, scientists have been able to sketch a rough timeline of the pterodactyl's progression.\n\n\"The head and neck evolved first, followed later by the body, tail, wings and legs,\" Unwin said.\n\nThe researchers say more study is needed to substantiate the idea of that evolution could occur relatively quickly, and that whole parts of a plant or animal's body could change at once.\n\nThe fossils indicate Darwinopterus was about the size of a crow, with long jaws, sharp, pointed teeth and a flexible neck.\n\nIt had \"hawk-like\" qualities, scientists say, which allowed the creature to kill and eat smaller, feathered dinosaurs which would later evolve into birds.\n\nPterodactyls were prevalent during the Mesozoic Era between 220 and 65 million years ago.\n\nThe research has been published in the \"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.\"",
