    (CNN) -- Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez insists Fernando Torres is happy at the English Premier League club after Manchester City were linked with a multi-million dollar bid for the Spain striker.<br><br>Torres has scored 18 goals in 22 league games for Liverpool this season but will miss the rest of the campaign after having surgery on a knee injury, meaning the 26-year-old faces a race to be fit for Spain's opening game in the World Cup against Switzerland on June 16.<br><br>City spent over $100 million in the transfer market before the start of this season and are currently battling for fourth spot in the league, which would guarantee a lucrative Champions League place.<br><br>Liverpool, meanwhile, sit in seventh place and look set to miss out on qualification for the money-spinning tournament. It has led to speculation that Torres could be top of City's wanted list once the season ends.<br><br>City's Italian manager Roberto Mancini told reporters: "We are a top team and I think all the top teams are interested in Torres but sometimes it depends on the player because they want to play in the Champions League.<br><br>"For me, he is with Carlos [Tevez], [Wayne] Rooney, [Lionel] Messi, [Zlatan] Ibrahimovic, [Cristiano] Ronaldo as the best in Europe. Fernando is a fantastic striker; all the teams in Europe would like him."<br><br>The City manager did admit a successful pursuit of Torres may only come about if the club can secure Champions League football next season: "If we don't get into the fourth position I think it will be difficult," he said.<br><br>Liverpool were knocked out of Champions League in the group stages but have progressed to the semifinal of the Europa League against Atletico Madrid. They lost the first leg 1-0 in the Spanish capital on Thursday.<br><br>After the game Benitez dismissed the possibility of Torres leaving the club. He told reporters: "Torres is happy. The thing he's thinking about now is being ready as soon as possible and that's it. From the beginning, he's said he's been very happy at Anfield.<br><br>"We have said repeatedly that Fernando is not for sale and he still has three years of his contract remaining, so how can they sign a player who does not wish to leave?"
