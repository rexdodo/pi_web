Kendall Myers sat with his arms folded across his chest, while his wife sat with her arms at her side. They stared straight ahead, and did not appear to acknowledge anyone in the courtroom.<br><br>A defense attorney urged the court to allow them to remain in their home, where they could visit with their children.<br><br>"You could disable the sailboat, freeze their funds and require ankle bracelets," Thomas Green said.<br><br>The judge allowed the couple to meet briefly with their son after the court proceedings, but turned down the request to allow them to go home.<br><br>He said he was concerned that the two would go to the Cuban Interests Section or the embassy of a country that has diplomatic relations with Cuba.

He had viewed more than 200 classified reports on Cuba in his final months, even though he was an analyst on European issues at the time, court documents say.<br><br>The couple has been held without bail since pleading not guilty Friday. A future trial date has not been scheduled.<br><br>CNN's Carol Cratty contributed to this report.
