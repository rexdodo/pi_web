The remains of seven still had ligatures -- string, cord or wire -- wrapped around their necks. The skull of one woman was wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the home's basement.<br><br>The grisly discoveries in Sowell's home have led to the case being called a "house of horrors."<br><br>Sowell served 15 years in prison for a 1989 attempted rape and was released in 2005. He was required to register as a sex offender.
