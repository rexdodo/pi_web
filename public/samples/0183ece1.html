"Tragedy leads to wisdom, and this experience has taught me so much about life."  Watch Steinhauer talk about his recovery »<br><br>The 22-year-old from Brooklyn was about to graduate and had a job lined up at accounting giant KPMG when he got into an argument last May that nearly cost him his life.<br><br>According to police, witnesses said Steinhauer and college basketball player Miladin Kovacevic had exchanged harsh words at an upstate New York bar near Binghamton University after Steinhauer danced with the girlfriend of one of Kovacevic's friends.<br><br>The witnesses said the fight went outside the bar, where several men attacked Steinhauer, with Kovacevic beating him about the head, according to police. Kovacevic is 6-foot-9 and 260 pounds while Steinhauer was 130 pounds.<br><br>Kovacevic was arrested but jumped bail and fled to Serbia with the help of Serbian consular officials in New York.<br><br>The case strained relations between the United States and Serbia.Hillary Clinton intervened, first as U.S. senator from New York and later as secretary of state, as did Sen.

While he can eat on his own now and is making significant progress, Steinhauer continues to undergo intensive therapy.<br><br>Steinhauer says he doesn't think about Kovacevic because he's not concerned about other people.<br><br>"I've had a second birth and raising at Mount Sinai," he said. "Live long and prosper."
