Jeffries, Polaroid chief executive officer.<br><br>"We expect to continue our operations as normal during the reorganization and are planning for new product launches in 2009," she said, adding that employees should receive their paychecks without interruption.<br><br>The bankruptcy filing was necessary because of an investigation of its parent company, Petters Group Worldwide, which has owned Polaroid since 2005, the Polaroid statement said.
