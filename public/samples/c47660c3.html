Myles, the U.S. ambassador to Cape Verde.<br><br>The relationship between the two countries is based on a long history of partnership, which started in 1818 when the first U.S. consulate in sub-Saharan Africa was established in the country, Myles said.<br><br>Clinton's 11-day trip started in Kenya, and has included stops in South Africa, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Liberia.<br><br>She arrived at Cape Verde from Liberia, where she applauded the work of pro-American president, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first woman elected head of state in Africa.<br><br>"Today, (Liberia) is a model of successful transition from conflict to post-conflict, from lawlessness to democracy, from despair to hope," Clinton said.<br><br>"For the last three years, the people of this country have been working to promote reform, reconstruction and reconciliation.

She blamed the lack of progress on corruption.<br><br>"The most immediate source of the disconnect between Nigeria's wealth and its poverty is a failure of governance at the local, state, and federal level," she said.  Watch Clinton compare election to 2000 U.S. presidential election »<br><br>During a visit to Congo, Clinton denounced sexual attacks on women and announced $17 million in funding to help fight abuse in the country.<br><br>"In the face of such evil, people of good will everywhere must respond," she said. "The United States is already a leading donor to efforts aimed at addressing these problems."<br><br>Clinton also met with the leaders of Somalia's transitional government in neighboring Nairobi. The country has been waging a bloody battle against al Qaeda-linked militants with help from the United States.<br><br>The State Department notes it is the earliest trip by a secretary of state and a president to Africa of any previous U.S. administration.
