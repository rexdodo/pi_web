He said there is a "wide range of opinions" on changing the policy.<br><br>The body is also scheduled to vote Wednesday on a social statement on sexuality that has been eight years in the making, he said.<br><br>"It's important for us because it informs the basis for policy," he said.<br><br>According to its Web site, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has 4.6 million members.<br><br>The church is not the only denomination that has dealt with the issue of gay clergy.<br><br>Last month, the Episcopal Church's House of Bishops voted by a wide margin to allow gays and lesbians to become bishops, Episcopal Life reported.<br><br>In April, the Presbyterian Church (USA) voted against allowing openly gay pastors to serve, according to the Presbyterian News Service.
