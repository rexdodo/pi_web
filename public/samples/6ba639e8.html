The second car was towed for a parking offense but drew suspicion because it smelled of gasoline.<br><br>Officials said both cars cars were filled with fuel, gas canisters, and nails. Police managed to defuse them.<br><br>The following day, with attention still focused on the averted attacks in the capital, a Jeep sped through the barriers outside Glasgow International Airport and slammed head on into the terminal.
