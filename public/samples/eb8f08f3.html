He will also address the biggest Muslim nation from an undetermined location.<br><br>However, Muslims in Indonesia remain pessimistic.<br><br>"Obama can talk all he wants in Cairo and in Jakarta, the fact is that he still has his troops in war with Muslims," Yusanto said.  "It's all lip service."<br><br>Protesters chanted "No Obama" and held up posters that said "Stop oppressor."<br><br>Obama's visit to Asia started Saturday with a three-day visit to India.<br><br>His visit to India -- the third largest economy and one of the world's few growth markets -- also includes meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi and addressing the nation's parliament.
