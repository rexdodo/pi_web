    MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- What do software mogul Bill Gates and banking investor Warren Buffett have in common with wanted Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman Loera?<br><br>Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman Loera, pictured in 1993, ranks 701st on Forbes' yearly report on billionaires.<br><br>They are all featured in Forbes magazine's world's billionaires report as "self-made" billionaires.<br><br>Guzman Loera, whose nickname means Shorty, escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001. He heads the powerful Sinaloa cartel, investigators say. Authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border blame the Sinaloa and other cartels for a surge in violence in the region.<br><br>He ranked 701st on Forbes' yearly report, with an estimated fortune of $1 billion.<br><br>Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora expressed outrage at the publication and described Forbes' calculations on Guzman Loera's fortune as mere "speculation."<br><br>"I will never accept that a criminal could be recognized as someone distinguished, even if it is by a magazine like Forbes," Medina Mora said to local media during a drug traffic summit Thursday in Vienna, Austria.<br><br>Forbes is "comparing the deplorable activity of a criminal wanted in Mexico and abroad with that of honest businessmen," he said.<br><br>Mexican President Felipe Calderon -- speaking at a business summit Thursday in Mexico City -- alluded to the report, saying, "It is very sad the intensification of a campaign, which seems to me, has been launched against Mexico."<br><br>Calderon added, "Public opinion and now even magazines not only attack and lie about the situation in Mexico, but now also praise criminals. In Mexico, it is considered a crime to praise criminals."  Guzman Loera has a three-decade history of drug trade spanning North, Central and South America. The Forbes profile of Guzman Loera reported that "the U.S. government is offering a $5 million reward" for the billionaire's capture.<br><br>Steve Forbes, the magazine's editor-in-chief, issued a statement on Saturday saying "it is deplorable that someone like this has a billion dollars." But the magazine, he said, was simply doing its job and reporting a fact.<br><br>"Forbes has listed other criminals from Meyer Lansky (1982) to Pablo Escobar (1987-1993) on our Rich Lists," Forbes said. "Don't shoot the messenger."<br><br>Its article offers a rationale as to why Guzman Loera made the list.<br><br>"So is there anywhere one can still make a fortune these days? The 38 newcomers offer a few clues. Among the more notable new billionaires are Mexican Joaquin Guzman Loera, one of the biggest suppliers of cocaine to the U.S."<br><br>CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.
