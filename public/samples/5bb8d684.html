    New York (CNN) -- Work on the National September 11 Memorial Museum has been halted over a budgetary dispute, delaying its opening, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.<br><br>"There's no chance of it being open on time. Work has basically stopped," Bloomberg said during a press conference Thursday.<br><br>The museum was scheduled to open on the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.<br><br>Bloomberg blamed the holdup on "disagreements" with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is responsible for a portion of the project's financing.<br><br>"The Port Authority has to spend money to do the infrastructure that they agreed to," the mayor said. "We have a legitimate claim against the Port Authority for delays for roughly $140 million dollars which has increased our cost."<br><br>Bloomberg did not specify when work on the museum halted. The Port Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<br><br>Bloomberg's disclosure of the setback came the same day the National September 11 Memorial & Museum Foundation announced that more than a million people have visited the site since it opened on the 10th anniversary of the attacks.<br><br>The memorial features two large reflecting pools in the footprints of the two towers.<br><br>Located underground in the former World Trade Center's "archaeological heart," the museum will feature 110,000 square feet of exhibition space, according to the website for The National September 11 Memorial & Museum foundation.<br><br>It will house a vast array of 9/11 artifacts, including "photographs, videotapes, voice messages, recovered property, clothing and other personal effects, workplace memorabilia, [and] incident-specific documents," among other items.<br><br>Bloomberg sounded a note of optimism, telling reporters that both sides would come to "some agreement pretty soon."<br><br>He also said he thought the disagreement would not require judges to resolve it. "I don't think it'll get to the court."
