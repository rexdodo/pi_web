    MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- Bollywood's recent financial growth has been as dizzying as the swirling dancers, colorful costumes and pulsating music that typify the industry's films.<br><br>Mumbai's once booming flamboyant Hindi-language film industry is hit hard, as overseas investment dries up.<br><br>Foreign money has poured into Mumbai's flamboyant Hindi-language film industry, which churns out more than 1,000 films each year. Twice as many films as Hollywood -- and for a fraction of the cost.<br><br>But a financial drama has arrived on the movie sets and production suites of India's largest city courtesy of the world economic downturn and a producer's strike -- fewer films are being made; less tickets are being sold and money is suddenly tight.<br><br>"It's become more difficult now to green light films; to be able to think of developing films," Nikhil Advani of People Tree Films who works as both a producer and a director told CNN.<br><br>"Today you think twice how you're going to be able to put that thing together before you commit any money to it."<br><br>It's the new reality: Money that was gushing into the market from abroad to finance films a year and a half ago is now just trickling in.<br><br>Production of Bollywood movies has only just resumed, having ground to a halt for seven weeks due to a producer's strike.  The strike is finally over, but money is still tight and this is affecting the number of films going into production.<br><br>"The number of movie projects has come down by almost 30 percent," Farokh Balsara, a partner at business consultants Ernst & Young told CNN. Balsara heads Ernst & Young's media and entertainment division in Mumbai and looks at trends in the market.<br><br>What's more, after several years of fast-rising film revenues due to India's exploding middle classes who were willing to spend, Bollywood finds itself back on a budget.<br><br>If you don't have a solid financial plan these days, getting funding for a film is nearly impossible. Throwing around a known filmmaking family name and getting a star signed up won't cut it anymore. "The easy finance is a thing of the past," Balsara told CNN.<br><br>Some producers are asking big name talent to take a cut in their pay or at least get paid on the "backend." In other words, waiting until the movie releases -- if it does well you get a piece of the pie; if not, you eat it.<br><br>In some cases, accountants are actually on movie sets crunching numbers daily to make sure the budget is on target. "They are getting into daily audits," Balsara said.<br><br>The thought of an accountant on set might make some producers shudder, but many believe the slowdown has done Bollywood a favor.<br><br>"Is that a good thing or a bad thing?" says Advani of the changes the slowdown has forced on the way he produces upcoming films. "I think it's a very good [thing]."<br><br>He currently has several in the works: an animated film in post-production called "Ab Dilli Door Nahin" and a gritty action-packed thriller "Basra,"  named after the Mumbai street term for heroin.<br><br>The slowdown has made Bollywood focus on making better, not more movies, according to Advani: "I don't call it a credit crunch, I call it a credit correction.<br><br>"I think what has happened is it's corrected itself, because I think Bollywood or the Indian film industry was going absolutely crazy last year."<br><br>Mairi Mackay contributed to this story.
