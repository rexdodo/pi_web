    Moscow (CNN) -- Russian election authorities officially registered Prime Minister Vladimir Putin Monday as a candidate for president in next year's election, they announced on their website.<br><br>Putin will represent his United Russia party, the Central Election Commission said.<br><br>The move is the latest step toward Putin's reclaiming the presidency after switching to the prime minister's office because of a law barring him from serving more than two consecutive terms as president.<br><br>Russia's third-richest man, the billionaire New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov, announced this month that he will run against Putin for president.<br><br>Many ordinary Russians suspect the Kremlin put Prokhorov up to it to give the impression the contest is fair.<br><br>Last week, Putin brushed off widespread criticism that the December 4 parliamentary elections in Russia were falsified.<br><br>He said their results "reflect the actual line-up of forces in the country, as well as the fact that the ruling force -- the United Russia party -- has lost certain positions."<br><br>Tens of thousands turned out to protest the election results that returned Putin's United Russia party to power, but with a smaller majority.<br><br>Police estimated crowds in Moscow on December 10 at 25,000, while organizers said the total was 40,000, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. Either figure would make the protests the largest in the Russian capital in 20 years.<br><br>Claiming the results of parliamentary elections were rigged, protesters chanted "Putin out."<br><br>They also braved freezing temperatures in other Russian cities to demonstrate against what they said was vote fraud.<br><br>Putin said in his question-and-answer session that protesters were positioning themselves for the presidential vote in March.<br><br>"It is obvious to me that the attacks on the latest election are secondary; their primary goal is the next election, the Russian presidential election," Putin said December 15.<br><br>The Organization for Security and Cooperation said in a preliminary report that some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was "slanted in favor of the ruling party."
