    WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy is having hundreds of its older F/A-18 fighter jets inspected, including some flying operations over Afghanistan, for cracks in part of a wing assembly, officials said Friday.<br><br>Inspectors looking at F/A-18 fighter jets have found 15 with stress crack problems on the wings.<br><br>Some 636 F/A-18 A through D model Hornets in both the Navy and the Marine Corps are being inspected for stress cracks on a hinge connecting the aileron to the flaps on the back side of the wings, according to Navy spokesmen.<br><br>Inspectors started looking at the planes Thursday and have found 15 aircrafts with the problem. A panel on the wing can be swapped out with a new one to get rid of the problem.<br><br>The Navy is still looking at the hinge in question to see whether the problem is severe enough to ground the Hornets and come up for a permanent fix for the hinge.<br><br>Navy officials said there are no immediate plans to ground the 636 planes.<br><br>This month, a post-flight inspection of one F/A-18 found a crack, and it was determined to be systemic enough to warrant an inspection of the older F/A-18s, according to Navy officials.<br><br>The Navy also flies the Super Hornet, a newer version of the F/A-18. That plane is not part of this inspection.<br><br>Navy flight operations around the world will not be interrupted because of the inspections, officials said.
