    LONDON, England (CNN) -- The super-yachts of the super-rich could soon become super-green.<br><br>The solar sail: super-yachts could cut fuel consumption and emissions by using a sail similar to this.<br><br>Sydney-based technology company Solar Sailor is working on a "solar sail" which could act as both a sail and a solar power source to all sorts of large vessels.<br><br>Super-yachts owned by billionaires like Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen are currently among the biggest fuel guzzlers on the planet.<br><br>Some of the ocean-going beasts like Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's "Dubai," the biggest private super-yacht in the world, are over 150 meters long and contain amenities like aircraft hangars, movie theaters, Jacuzzis, and swimming pools.<br><br>All of these features sap incredible amounts of energy.<br><br>Fuel consumption estimates on super-yachts have ranged up to one liter of fuel per second when traveling at high power.<br><br>• See a photo gallery of the world's best super-yachts<br><br>Solar Sailor's CEO Robert Dane told CNN the technology could work perfectly with super-yachts. He said the solar sails had the ability to significantly reduce the boats' fuel consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions.<br><br>"We think it would enable people to have their super-yacht but make little or no carbon footprint, which is the big problem with these vessels," he said.<br><br>Dane said the technology worked by using a wing that is a solar panel or a sail, pivotally mounted to a vessel so it can be angled to the sun or the wind.<br><br>The "sails" are controlled by a computer which takes into account the direction and strength of sun and wind to optimize energy collection.<br><br>A design project is currently underway in the United Kingdom to create a solar sail for the super-yachts, he said.<br><br>Dane said the company was working with Chinese shipping company COSCO to get solar sails on some of its fleet.<br><br>"Our aim is for a trail of retrofitted sails to one bulker and one tanker in 2010. Based on the results of this, then we would design 'new-build' vessels," he said.<br><br>Dane estimated the sail could save about 5 percent in fuel consumption from the solar power and another 20 to 40 percent from wind power when the vessel is traveling at 18 knots.<br><br>"This might add up to a 10 percent saving overall in the whole journey," Dane said.<br><br>He said there were further hopes that the technology could be improved by developing systems to raise and lower sails with fewer moving parts and store energy more efficiently.
