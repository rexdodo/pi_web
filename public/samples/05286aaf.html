They worked with detectives from the Phoenix Drug Enforcement Administration during the 15-month investigation, at least a part of which was conducted undercover.<br><br>"The success of this operation is a direct result of Law Enforcement agencies working cooperatively toward a common goal. That goal is to rid our communities of organized crime," Tempe Chief of Police Tom Ryff said in the statement.<br><br>"These are sophisticated, criminal enterprises. As Chief of Police, I am committed to working in partnership with the community and other law enforcement agencies to curtail drug trafficking in the City of Tempe and throughout the valley," he added.<br><br>Police said the dismantled trafficking ring was linked to the much-feared Sinaloa cartel, which has been blamed for widespread acts of violence across the border in Mexico.<br><br>In October, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said that at least 70 suspected drug smugglers with alleged ties to the Sinaloa cartel had been arrested.<br><br>More than 20 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies were involved in that 17-month investigation, dubbed "Operation Pipeline Express."
