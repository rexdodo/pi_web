"If he does anything good, it will be for himself."<br><br>With an assault rifle on his lap, Khan answered 10 written questions, sharing his view on a range of topics from slavery to Obama's middle name -- Hussein.<br><br>He spoke in the remote Swat Valley of northwestern Pakistan, the site of frequent and fierce clashes between Pakistani troops and Taliban and al Qaeda militants.<br><br>There was no opportunity for follow-up questions.<br><br>Khan said Obama's election may change conditions for black Americans.<br><br>"The black one knows how much the black people are discriminated against in America and Europe and other countries," he said. "For America's black people, it could be that there will be a change. That era is coming."<br><br>He said he doubted Obama's victory would lead to changes in relations between the United States and the Taliban.  Watch the Taliban spokesman on Barack Obama »<br><br>U.S. forces dislodged the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan shortly after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.<br><br>America and its allies have battled the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan ever since, with fighting spreading across the border into Pakistan.<br><br>"American should take its army out of the country," Khan said.

"If Barack Obama pursues the same policies as Bush and behaves like Bush ... then he cannot be Hussein. He can only be Obama."
