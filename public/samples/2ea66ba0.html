    LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Love hurts, especially for jilted lovers on Valentine's Day.<br><br>With that in mind, a London tourist attraction is offering visitors the chance to curse former boyfriends, girlfriends or spouses -- and get a discount on the entry price at the same time.<br><br>"Hex your Ex" is the Valentine's Day promotion at the London Dungeon, a house of horrors that takes visitors through elements of the city's bloody, gruesome, and torturous past.<br><br>To qualify, visitors must bring a picture of their ex -- or anyone who has  shunned them -- then rip it up and throw it in a smoking cauldron, spokeswoman Kate Edwards told CNN. Visitors can then select from a range of curses to inflict on their ex.<br><br>"If you happen to be single or freshly shunned, this is a way to move on and have a great way of doing it," Edwards said.<br><br>Hexing your ex will earn you £5 ($7.20) off the entry price.<br><br>"It's very therapeutic, but it means in times of the credit crunch, you get money off as well," she said.<br><br>The "curses" are meant to be taken lightly, she said. All were developed by the Dungeon's creative team.<br><br>"They involve marvelously bad things happening to your ex," she said. "Nothing deadly, obviously. It's obviously tongue-in-cheek."
