    LONDON, England (CNN) -- A London department store has started selling coffee for $100 a shot.<br><br>Civet cats: The coffee beans are collected from the animal's faeces.<br><br>If the price sounds unappealing, shoppers also have to overcome the unusual method of cultivation, which sees the coffee beans harvested from the feces of an Indonesian jungle cat.<br><br>Even so, the Peter Jones store says the luxury blend -- called Caffé Raro -- is one of the world's rarest and most premium coffees.<br><br>Made by the Italian company De Longhi, Caffé Raro combines Jamaican Blue Mountain and Kupi Luwak, two extremely rare coffees.<br><br>The beans of Kupi Luwak are harvested after being ingested by civet cats, and only about 260 kilos (about 573 pounds) of the coffee is produced each year.<br><br>"The cats select the best beans to chew. It's rather like a natural filtering process," said Carie Barkhuzen, a spokeswoman for the upmarket store in London's upmarket Sloane Square.<br><br>The coffee, which went on sale Thursday, is available at $100 for a shot at the Peter Jones Espresso Bar, or shoppers can buy 100g (3.5-ounce) packs of the coffee beans to take away for the same price.  Watch some willing to try the coffee, others not »<br><br>"It's not exactly flying off the shelves -- it's very expensive, after all -- but customers are buying it," Barkhuzen said.<br><br>The proceeds from the coffee sales will go to charity.
