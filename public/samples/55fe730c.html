    BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq awarded a lucrative oil contract to BP and China National Petroleum Corp., government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said Wednesday, while rejecting other companies' offers for other oil fields.<br><br>BP and China National Petroleum Corporation have won a lucrative oil contract in Iraq.<br><br>The joint BP-CNPC bid was for the al-Rumeila oil field, one of the largest in the world. The energy companies are expected to increase production at the oil field by 50 percent, to 285,000 barrels a day, for a service charge of $2 for each additional barrel produced, al-Dabbagh said in a statement.<br><br>The Iraqi government rejected bids for five other oil fields and a natural gas field because the bidders did not agree to the service charge set by the Ministry of Oil, he said.<br><br>The Ministry of Oil rejected the idea that the failure to award more than one contract made the much-anticipated auction a flop.<br><br>Iraq did not say how much the BP-CNPC bid was worth. It runs for 20 years.<br><br>Oil Minister Hussein Shahrastani chaired the government-sponsored auction for the oil and natural gas field contracts Tuesday, after a day's delay due to a sandstorm.<br><br>Much of the auction was broadcast live on state television, which Ministry of Oil spokesman Assem Jihad told CNN was a sign of the transparency of the process.<br><br>He said the government was satisfied with the auction, even though only one contract was awarded, because the contract was for Iraq's largest oil field.<br><br>Iraq plans to open bidding this year on 10 more oil fields and one natural gas field, all of which are undeveloped, Jihad said.<br><br>The companies whose bids were rejected Tuesday have been given time to review their offers, he said.<br><br>Iraq has some of the largest oil reserves in the world, with an estimated 115 billion barrels -- tying Iran for second place, behind Saudi Arabia's 264 billion barrels, according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration in the United States.<br><br>CNN's Jomana Karadsheh in Baghdad contributed to this report.
