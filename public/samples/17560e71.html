    Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- Long lines formed under the watchful eye of American and multinational troops as a wide-scale food distribution effort reached capacity Thursday in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.<br><br>Nearly 160,000 Haitian women each collected a 25-kilogram (55 pounds) bag of rice under a distribution plan coordinated by the United Nations, several private humanitarian agencies and the Haitian government.<br><br>The effort was launched Sunday but not all 16 fixed distribution points around the capital were operational until Thursday.<br><br>So far, 600,000 people affected by the devastating January 12 earthquake have been able to collect food under this plan, said Marcus Prior, spokesman for the United Nations World Food Programme.<br><br>"We're encouraged by the way the system is working to get food out into the city to those in need, but still have a long way to go," Prior said.<br><br>Only women were given food coupons beforehand and allowed to stand in line to collect for their families.<br><br>"Our long experience in food distribution tells us that by delivering food into the hands of women, it is more likely to be redistributed equitably among the household -- including the men," Prior said.<br><br>U.S. and U.N. troops have been keeping strict control over the crowds. Prior said the distribution plan has been orderly so far.<br><br>The death toll from the earthquake has reached 212,000, Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said Thursday.<br><br>More than 300,000 people were injured and more than 1 million were made homeless, he told CNN's "Larry King Live."
