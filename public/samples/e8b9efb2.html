    (CNN) -- The number of people worldwide without access to a toilet -- no public restroom, no outhouse, no latrine, no smallest room -- is a whopping 2.6 billion. That's four out of ten people.<br><br>The bucket toilet is the only thing on offer for millions of black South Africans.<br><br>According to the World Toilet Organization, 2.2 million people, predominantly children, die every year from diarrhea -- more than from malaria, from AIDS, from TB. That number dwarfs any casualties related to violent conflict.<br><br>These figures are intrinsically related. The underestimation of fecal contamination is staggering, sobering -- and unfortunately, silencing.<br><br>Singaporean social-entrepreneur Jack Sim founded the non-profit World Toilet Organization ("the other WTO") in 2001, as a support network for all existing organizations.<br><br>It now includes 151 members from 53 countries, which meet once a year to network, discuss sanitation issues and work together toward "eliminating the toilet taboo and delivering sustainable sanitation."<br><br>Goal number one: Making sanitation speakable. "What we don't discuss, we can't improve," insists Sim.<br><br>This year, the World Toilet Summit & Expo 2008 was held from November 4-6 in Macau under the theme "Driving Sustainable Sanitation through Market-Based Initiatives."<br><br>Indeed, not only is sanitation a good idea, it's a good investment.<br><br>Biosolids can be composted into fertilizer, sewage can be processed into methane biogas, and even simple latrines in India are producing compost and fertilizer.<br><br>"Globally, if universal sanitation were achieved by 2015, it would cost $95 billion, but it would save $660 billion," writes Rose George in her newly released book "The Big Necessity."<br><br>Real-world examples follow: "When Peru had a cholera outbreak in 1991, it cost $1 billion to contain but could have been prevented with $100 million of better sanitation measures."<br><br>Or even more alarming: "Pakistan, for example, spends 47 times more on its military budget than on water and sanitation, though it loses 120,000 people to diarrhea a year."<br><br>So while 2.6 billion people have no toilet, how many millions of us simply "flush and forget"?<br><br>Eco-sanitation, or the problem of dealing efficiently and ecologically with sewer systems, wastewater, treatment and purification, is no less a serious one.<br><br>In the UK alone, the sewage system emits some 28.8 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.<br><br>As sewers become overloaded with urban development, drought strikes various regions of the earth, and potable water becomes increasingly scarce, even the flush toilet is now put into question.<br><br>Today, those who care are looking at innovative toilet and waste-disposal solutions from India, China and other parts of the developing world, where attitudes and habits are still evolving and open to change.<br><br>Don't forget, World Toilet Day is November 19.
