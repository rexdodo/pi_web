    (CNN) -- Leading jockey Frankie Dettori may have spent most of his life on a diet, but when it comes to his favorite pastimes food is right up there with racing.<br><br>Around five years ago Dettori met Michelin-starred chef Marco Pierre White and asked him where he could go out with his young family to eat.<br><br>"I couldn't answer the question," Marco Pierre White told CNN, "and that's how Frankie's was born. That simple."<br><br>They opened their first restaurant in London in 2004. Now there are four in London, one in Shanghai and one in Dubai.<br><br>This March, a cookbook followed: "Frankie Dettori's Italian Family Cookbook." This is his favorite recipe. Enjoy!<br><br>Frankie: "My father loved this particular dish as, although it's vegetarian, it has the meaty and slightly smoky texture of a good steak. To this day it makes me think of childhood Sunday lunches."<br><br>Parmigiana di Melanzane / Aubergine Parmigiana<br><br>INGREDIENTS<br><br>1 kg aubergines<br><br>extra virgin olive oil<br><br>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br><br>2 garlic cloves, chopped<br><br>3 x 400g cans of good quality tinned tomatoes, sieved and chopped<br><br>a small handful of fresh basil leaves<br><br>a large handful of finely grated Parmesan<br><br>1½ kg fresh Mozzarella, cubed<br><br>Preheat the oven to 180 C/350 F/Gas Mark 4.<br><br>Cut the aubergines in ½cm strips, lengthwise. Sprinkle each slice with salt and layer on a plate. Cover with a plate of the same size and add a heavy weight on top (such as a large bottle of water) so that water can be squeezed out of the aubergines. Set aside for 2-3 hours.<br><br>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a saucepan, add the garlic and fry until slightly golden. Add the tomatoes and basil, and cook over a medium heat for 25 minutes, until the sauce thickens. Season to taste.<br><br>Remove the weight from the aubergine, thoroughly rinse the slices and pat dry. Generously cover the bottom of a large frying pan with olive oil and place over a high heat. In batches, brown the aubergine slices on both sides, lowering the heat and adding oil as required. Drain the slices on kitchen roll as you go along.<br><br>Cover the bottom of a 23cm x 30cm ovenproof dish with a thin layer of tomato sauce; add a layer of aubergine slices, then top with a handful of the cheeses. Ladle some tomato sauce over this and continue layering, finishing with one of tomato sauce and a sprinkling of cheeses.<br><br>Bake for 15-20 minutes to heat through and melt the Mozzarella, then set aside for a few minutes to cool. Cut into squares and serve warm.<br><br>Serves 8<br><br>Preparation time: 3 hours<br><br>Cooking time: 50 minutes<br><br>Courtesy: Harpercollins Publishers E-mail to a friend
