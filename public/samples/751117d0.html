    BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- At least 6,000 Christians have fled the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in the past week because of killings and death threats, Iraq's Ministry of Immigration and Displaced Persons said Thursday.<br><br>A Christian family that fled Mosul found refuge in the Al-Sayida monastery about 30 miles north of the city.<br><br>The number represents 1,424 families, at least 70 more families than were reported to be displaced on Wednesday.<br><br>The ministry said it had set up an operation room to follow up sending urgent aid to the displaced Christian families as a result of attacks by what it called "terrorist groups."<br><br>Iraqi officials have said the families were frightened by a series of killings and threats by Muslim extremists ordering them to convert to Islam or face death.<br><br>Fourteen Christians have been slain in the past two weeks in the city, which is about 260 miles (420 kilometers) north of Baghdad.<br><br>Mosul is one of the last Iraqi cities where al Qaeda in Iraq has a significant presence and routinely carries out attacks.
