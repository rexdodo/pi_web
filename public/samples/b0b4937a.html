    (CNN) -- The wife of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid underwent neck surgery Friday after being injured with their daughter in a four-vehicle wreck in suburban Washington a day earlier, her surgeon said.<br><br>Since the surgery, Landra Reid, 69, has been able "to get out of bed, her pain is well-controlled and she's able to swallow some," said Dr. Elizabeth Franco of Inova Fairfax Hospital.<br><br>She can move her arms and legs, but is expected to go through physical therapy before being released in a few days, Franco said.<br><br>Reid's wife broke her neck, a vertebra in her lower back and her nose, the doctor said.<br><br>The couple's adult daughter, Lana Reid Barringer of McLean, Virginia, suffered a neck injury and facial lacerations, the senator's spokesman, Jon Summers, said Thursday. Lana Reid was released from the hospital Thursday night.<br><br>The wreck occurred in the northbound lanes of Interstate 95 in Fairfax County at 1:10 p.m., when the 2005 Honda Odyssey driven by the daughter began braking in stop-and-go traffic and was rear-ended by a tractor-trailer, according to a Virginia State Police report.<br><br>"The impact forced the Honda Odyssey to rear-end the vehicle in front of it, a 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee," it says. "The Jeep Grand Cherokee was then forced into the next lane over where it struck a 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt."<br><br>The drivers of the Jeep and the Chevrolet also were taken to Inova Fairfax Hospital. Their injuries were not considered life-threatening.<br><br>The driver of the truck, Allan W. Snader, 59, of Ohio, was charged with reckless driving, the police report said. He was not injured in the crash. The tractor-trailer was carrying rolls of plastic.<br><br>The 70-year-old senator visited his wife and daughter shortly after hearing of the accident at 2:15 p.m., then returned to his office in the Capitol to work on health care legislation, said Reid spokesman Jim Manley.<br><br>He was back at the hospital later in the afternoon and stayed until midnight, then returned early Friday to be there for his wife's surgery, Summers said.<br><br>Summers told reporters Landra Reid's recovery is the senator's top priority, but "his plans have not changed at all" in Congress.<br><br>"Landra and I have been married for 50 years -- she is the love of my life," Reid said in a statement read by Summers at a news conference. "And I look forward to her making a quick recovery as soon as possible."<br><br>Reid met his wife at Basic High School in Henderson, Nevada, during the mid-1950s. They married in 1959 and had their first child, Lana, two years later. Three boys followed. The couple has 16 grandchildren.<br><br>CNN Congressional Producer Ted Barrett and Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.
