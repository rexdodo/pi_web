However, it is still less vigorous than that observed last weekend," the observatory said.<br><br>Peter Cervelli, a research geophysicist with the observatory, told CNN that "every indication is that we're heading toward an eruption."<br><br>Cervelli said scientists don't know exactly when it will happen, but if it does happen, it could be days or weeks -- or even hours.<br><br>"I would not be surprised to see it erupt at anytime," Cervelli said.
