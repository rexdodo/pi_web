    (CNN) -- Scientists say a very rare find of some 20 fossilized pterodactyls has produced the first clear evidence of a controversial theory of evolution.<br><br>This image shows the fossilized skeleton of Darwinopterus which was found in north-east China earlier this year.<br><br>The fossils were found in northeast China earlier this year, embedded in rock dating back 160 million years, and have been called "Darwinopterus" after the renowned naturalist Charles Darwin.<br><br>The creature's discovery has astounded scientists because their age puts them within two recognized groups of pterodactyls -- primitive long-tailed forms and advanced short-tail forms -- and they display characteristics of both.<br><br>The combination of features indicates that the primitive pterodactyls evolved relatively quickly, and that certain groups of features changed at the same time.<br><br>Traditional evolutionary theory suggests that one feature -- a tail for instance -- would slowly evolve over time.<br><br>"Darwinopterus came as quite a shock to us," said David Unwin, from the University of Leicester's School of Museum Studies, which identified the creature, along with researchers from the Geological Institute of Beijing.<br><br>"We had always expected a gap-filler with typically intermediate features such as a moderately elongate tail -- neither long nor short -- but the strange thing about Darwinopterus is that it has a head and neck just like that of advanced pterosaurs, while the rest of the skeleton, including a very long tail, is identical to that of primitive forms," he said.<br><br>By comparing the fossil with others from earlier and later periods, scientists have been able to sketch a rough timeline of the pterodactyl's progression.<br><br>"The head and neck evolved first, followed later by the body, tail, wings and legs," Unwin said.<br><br>The researchers say more study is needed to substantiate the idea of that evolution could occur relatively quickly, and that whole parts of a plant or animal's body could change at once.<br><br>The fossils indicate Darwinopterus was about the size of a crow, with long jaws, sharp, pointed teeth and a flexible neck.<br><br>It had "hawk-like" qualities, scientists say, which allowed the creature to kill and eat smaller, feathered dinosaurs which would later evolve into birds.<br><br>Pterodactyls were prevalent during the Mesozoic Era between 220 and 65 million years ago.<br><br>The research has been published in the "Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences."
