    HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwean lawmakers on Monday narrowly voted for Lovemore Moyo as speaker of the parliament -- making him the first opposition lawmaker to hold the position in the country's history.<br><br>Morgan Tsvangirai's MDC faction has a slim majority following parliamentary elections.<br><br>"This is historic as it ceases to be a rubber-stamping house," Moyo said after winning the position. "It will ensure that progressive laws are passed. I promise to be professional."<br><br>Moyo -- the national chairman of the main Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party -- received 110 votes while his only opponent, Paul Themba-Nyathi, received 98 votes. The speaker of the parliament is the fourth most powerful post in Zimbabwe.<br><br>Themba-Nyathi represented the splinter MDC faction led by Arthur Mutambara, but he had support of President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party.<br><br>The vote took place hours after Mugabe swore in lawmakers, five months after they were elected.<br><br>Two members of the main MDC -- led by presidential candidate Morgan Tsvangirai -- were arrested as they arrived at the opening session, but they were released after a short time, according to a government spokesman.<br><br>An MDC official said the arrests were part of the "sinister agenda of this regime" to "tilt the balance of numbers in their favour during the voting for the speaker of parliament."<br><br>One of those detained -- Shuwa Mudiwa -- appeared back in parliament, but the other member -- Elia Jembere -- was not seen, according to sources.<br><br>Government spokesman Bright Matonga said Jembere had been accused of rape, but that he has been released from custody.<br><br>A third member -- Elton Mangoma -- escaped an arrest attempt when other party members came to his rescue, MDC officials said.<br><br>Attendance at the session of parliament is important since the membership is closely divided between the MDC and the Mugabe's ZANU-PF.<br><br>The ruling ZANU-PF party lost its majority in the 210-seat parliament in elections in March, but vote recounts and political violence have delayed the body from convening until now.<br><br>Final results gave 100 seats to an MDC faction led by Morgan Tsvangirai, the party's presidential candidate. President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF got 99 seats. An offshoot of the main MDC party, led by Arthur Mutambara, won 10 seats. An independent candidate won one seat.<br><br>Tsvangirai, who was locked in a bitter presidential contest with Mugabe, had objected to Mugabe's decision to convene parliament, saying it could "decapitate" power-sharing talks that have been on hold for the past two weeks.<br><br>Still, Tsvangirai said he would attend the swearing-in ceremony.<br><br>MDC party spokesman Nelson Chamisa said all MDC members elected to parliament were expected to attend "except those few MPs who are still in hiding."<br><br>CNN's Nkepile Mabuse in Johannesburg, South Africa contributed to this report.
