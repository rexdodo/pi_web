    (CNN) -- France and Britain plan to abstain from a Security Council vote on the Palestinians' bid for statehood, two U.N. diplomats said Thursday.<br><br>France told members of the U.N. Security Council about its intentions at a Thursday afternoon meeting of the admissions committee for new U.N. membership, a Security Council diplomat told CNN.<br><br>Another U.N. diplomat told CNN that Britain will also abstain, with one of its representatives likewise announcing its intentions at the same closed-door meeting.<br><br>The U.N. Security Council is set to meet November 11 to discuss a report about whether or not to admit a Palestinian state as a member of the international organization. The membership bid has been controversial, with Israel among those opposed.<br><br>Diplomats have said it appears unlikely the Palestinians will succeed in their bid, given that the United States -- one of five permanent security council members -- has warned it will veto the attempt.<br><br>However, a veto may not be necessary if a minimum of nine nations -- out of 15 on the U.N. council -- don't support the Palestinians' bid.
