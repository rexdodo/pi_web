But he was then approached by a plain clothes official who told him to turn off his cellphone before ordering Jalaeipour to follow him.<br><br>"We didn't get a chance to talk to each other -- I was watching what was happening and that was the last time I saw him," said Shams, 26, who flew to the UK via Doha in Qatar.

"We believed we should take part to make our country better and to have a better future. We were encouraging young people to not be indifferent about their country."<br><br>Shams said she thinks he may have been detained because of his political activities.<br><br>"Most of the activists who have been supporting the reformist candidate, all of them are in prison now. Why should the young people who want to do something for the sake of their country and their people, why are they in prison now?"<br><br>Shams said she planned to return to Iran herself if there was no change in her husband's situation in the next week or so. But she but admitted her own safety could not be guaranteed if she went back.<br><br>Following more than a week of daily demonstrations in Tehran, Iranian security forces have been cracking down on protests and arresting activists including Ebrahim Yazdi, a former deputy prime minister who headed a group supporting increased freedom and democracy.
