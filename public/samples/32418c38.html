    Editor's note: We asked readers to weigh in on CNN.com Live producer Jarrett Bellini's vacation destination, and you chose South Africa. Check back for updates on his trip.<br><br>CNN.com's Jarrett Bellini tours vineyards outside Cape Town, South Africa.<br><br>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (CNN) -- I'm not a wine drinker.<br><br>Before today's excursion, in fact, I could only tell you that on the face of the planet there existed three types of wine: red, white and Carlo Rossi.  The reds are good with meat.  The whites go with fish.  And, according to what I learned from my dad, Carlo Rossi goes with a glass of ice.<br><br>So, exploring South Africa's wine country, just a short drive from Cape Town, seemed like a perfect educational way for me to spend my day.  I mean, it was that or go to a museum.<br><br>Our guide, Jack, was amazingly knowledgeable about the subject, but without being a pretentious jerk.  Really, as far as he is concerned, the best wine in the world is whatever wine you enjoy.  I didn't ask, but was curious if that applied to Boone's Farm?<br><br>Throughout the day, we hit four wineries, tasting 23 bottles in all.  I know because I kept hash marks on my hand.  I'm pretty classy.<br><br>Now, despite the outstanding info we received from our guide as we sipped and swirled and spat, I can't say that I'm any better at understanding the finer points of wine than I was this morning when I woke up.  However, I did manage to get a solid buzz.  And that should be worth something.<br><br>Even without the wine, a visit to South Africa's vineyards is a great addition to a traveler's to-do list. It's not far from the city and the scenery is beautiful. If you need an added incentive, there are even a few cheese farms in the area where you can really crank the whole experience up to 11.<br><br>I personally thanked one of the goats for his contribution. He didn't seem to care. He also didn't seem physically capable of producing anything that might actually turn into cheese. But I thanked him anyway.<br><br>What can I say? I'm not a wine drinker.
