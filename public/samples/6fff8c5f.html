The documents included passports, identity cards and household registers.<br><br>However, the organization intends to further investigate the ages of two gymnasts, Dong Fangxiao and Yang Yun, who participated in the 2000 summer games in Sydney, Australia. The federation said it did not consider  the explanations and evidence that Chinese authorities provided in regard to those athletes as satisfactory.<br><br>The International Olympic Committee had asked gymnastics officials to clarify the situation after numerous commentators, bloggers and others questioned whether about half the members of China's team were old enough to compete.  Watch tiny gymnasts work out »<br><br>Athletes must be at least 16 in the year the games take place. In women's gymnastics, younger girls can have an advantage over older competitors on account of their often smaller, lighter and more agile bodies.<br><br>The Chinese women's gymnastics team won a gold medal in a team competition at the Beijing games, and five members won individual medals.<br><br>One of the challenges came from a blogger known as "Stryde Hax."

Other bloggers joined the search and reported similar results.<br><br>The New York Times conducted its own investigation, producing similar results that seem to implicate He and two other members of the team. The Times uncovered a 2006 biography on He that lists her birthday as January 1, 1994.<br><br>The International Gymnastics Federation, however, has said that those gymnasts were eligible and that the ages on their passports were correct.<br><br>Chinese gymnastics coaches also defended their team.<br><br>"Asians have different figures than people from the West, so that's what caused their suspicion," said Huang Yubin, head coach of the men's and women's teams, referring to media inquiries. "They shouldn't be suspicious."
