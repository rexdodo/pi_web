    TAMPA, Florida (CNN) -- Some Florida minimum-security inmates want to know: Can you handle the heat?<br><br>Inmates work with peppers at the Hillsborough County Jail in Tampa, Florida.<br><br>Hot sauce heat, that is -- Jail House Fire Hot Sauce, cooked up by inmates at the Hillsborough County Jail and now offered for sale.<br><br>The idea to make Jail House Fire Hot Sauce came from a Cuban former inmate who thought food in the big house was bland.<br><br>Allen Boatman, the head of the jail's horticulture program, remembers what his former trusty said: "We're growing these peppers. Why don't we use them?"<br><br>Peppers are grown as part of the jail's horticulture program, which is voluntary and offered only to minimum-security trusties. The inmates learn about growing plants, ornamentals, trees, herbs and vegetables -- including more than 1,200 varieties of peppers.<br><br>"I thought that was a great idea, so I started doing research on some of the recipes," says Boatman. The research led to a variety of hot sauces that can be bought for $7 a bottle at the jail in Tampa, Florida, or online at www.jailhousefire.org.<br><br>There are three different sauces for sale:<br><br>Coming soon is a fourth sauce: Misdemeanor.  Watch the inmates at work on hot sauce »<br><br>Orders for the Jail House Fire sauces have come in from as far away as Germany, England and even Australia.<br><br>The inmates make no money from this product. The money goes back into an inmate fund that pays for things like the greenhouse where the peppers are grown.<br><br>The horticulture program pays for itself, says Boatman, so no taxpayer money is used.<br><br>Several times a year the program hosts a sale of its ornamentals, shrubs and trees, and the locals turn up to support the program. The money raised is used to purchase necessities like fertilizer and soil.<br><br>A green thumb is not the only thing that inmate and program member Deline is developing, he says.<br><br>"We learn a lot about professionalism, respect, teamwork, ya know -- all that helps," Deline says.<br><br>And working in the fields is good for the inmates' self-worth, Boatman says.<br><br>"They actually see something growing that they've been involved in. It gives them a lot of sense of pride and accomplishment," says Boatman. "Possibly that'll give them some momentum when they are released to go and get a job and start being a productive member of society."<br><br>Boatman doesn't just wish his trusties a good future; he gives them an opportunity. When the inmates are released, they are given a certificate of completion in vocational horticulture. This certificate comes from the school board, with no mention of the program behind bars.<br><br>Deline hopes this will work in his favor when he starts looking for a job.<br><br>"Florida is full of a lot of landscaping [and] landscaping companies, a lot of nursery companies," Deline says. "Maybe I can use the experience to better myself in the future."
