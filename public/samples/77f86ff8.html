    (CNN)  -- U.S. and NATO forces are engaged in a futile war against the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, Canada's prime minister said.<br><br>Canadian leader Stephen Harper says he backs President Obama's "renewed commitment to Afghanistan."<br><br>"We are not going to ever defeat the insurgency," Stephen Harper told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an interview that aired Sunday. "Afghanistan has probably had -- my reading of Afghanistan history -- it's probably had an insurgency forever, of some kind."<br><br>Harper's blunt assessment comes as nearly 2,800 Canadian forces are fighting in Afghanistan. The country's parliament has voted to pull them out by 2011.<br><br>Harper spoke with Zakaria last week after a visit by President Obama, who made Canada his first foreign trip since taking office in January. Obama has said Afghanistan is the central front to the U.S.-led war on terror.<br><br>The Pentagon is in the process of sending an additional 17,000 troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total there to 55,000.<br><br>Harper told CNN that he supports Obama's "renewed commitment to Afghanistan" but said he would not recommit any more Canadian troops until there is a clear plan for leaving Afghanistan.<br><br>"What has to happen in Afghanistan is, we have to have an Afghan government that is capable of managing that insurgency and improving its own governance," Harper said.<br><br>"If President Obama wants anybody to do more, I would ask very hard questions about what is the strategy for success and for an eventual departure."
