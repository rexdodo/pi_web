    LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Packing on the pounds over the holidays? Adam Sandler can sympathize. He recently put on some weight himself.<br><br>Adam Sandler had to cope with more than just falling gumballs in his latest comedy, "Bedtime Stories."<br><br>The comedian got buff for the movie "You Don't Mess With the Zohan" (in which he showed a lot of skin), but then he said he let himself go just a bit.<br><br>"[For 'Zohan'] I worked out like a madman," he told CNN. "And then I started getting fat again."<br><br>Concern over his physical conditioning led to an unintended consequence -- a broken bone.<br><br>"[One Saturday] I ate so much food, that I was laying in bed. I was fat as heck and I said, 'I better play some ball.' I went out and played basketball, broke my ankle. I said, 'Maybe I should have stayed fat.' "<br><br>The mishap occurred as he was filming his latest comedy, "Bedtime Stories." In scenes that involved walking around, Sandler needed a body double.<br><br>"I'm shooting the movie with the cast on," he said. "We did about six, seven weeks of shooting. If I was standing here and I had to walk to the door, I would stand up [then the camera would cut to] a guy with my outfit on that took the walk."<br><br>Sandler is on the mend, but he said his ankle is still a little swollen.<br><br>"Bedtime Stories" opens Christmas Day.
