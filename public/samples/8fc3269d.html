    (CNN) -- Pitcher Derek Holland restricted St. Louis Cardinals to just two hits in eight and a third innings to help Texas Rangers record a 4-0 win Sunday night to level the World Series at 2-2.<br><br>The Cardinals had hit 16 runs in a comprehensive victory in game three on Saturday, with Dominican Albert Pujols smashing three home runs, but Holland was instrumental as the Rangers scored a shut-out success.<br><br>"Our pitcher was in complete control of the game," Rangers designated hitter Michael Young told Major League Baseball's (MLB) official website. "That was the story of the game.<br><br>"Every game in the postseason is huge -- every game is massive, and rightfully so -- but Derek pitched a great game tonight."<br><br>Young's view was echoed by the Cardinals' designated hitter, Lance Berkman, who conceded Holland had been the difference between the two teams.<br><br>"He was on," said Berkman, 35. "The story of the game, for me, is Derek Holland was better than the St. Louis Cardinals tonight. He just was. He was great."<br><br>The Rangers' manager Ron Washington was full of praise for the left-hander, saying the 25-year-old showed his game-winning quality.<br><br>"We needed him to go out there and pitch well and he did," Washington said. "He showed the world what he's capable of doing."<br><br>The Rangers' first run came at the bottom of the first, with Elvis Andrus running in from first base to score off the batting of Josh Hamilton.<br><br>The game's deciding moment came at the bottom of the sixth, when Mike Napoli went deep off pitcher Mitchell Boggs to score three for Texas and cement their winning lead.<br><br>The Rangers are searching for the first World Series triumph with Game Five in the best-of-seven series Monday night in Texas.<br><br>Game Six is at the Cardinals' Busch Stadium Wednesday.
