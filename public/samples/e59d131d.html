    NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- While many now recognize the scientific explanation for a solar eclipse, the phenomenon is still marked with tradition and sometimes suspicion in Hindu-majority India.<br><br>People test the "sky watching telescope" at the Gujarat Council of Science City in India.<br><br>The "exceptionally long" eclipse that will cross half the planet Wednesday will be able to be seen by virtually all of the population of China and India.<br><br>For beggars in India, the occasion means an extra day of receiving alms and food.<br><br>The panhandler in Sandeep Jaggi's neighborhood normally visits the block every week on Tuesdays and Saturdays, as well as the days of a new and full moon.<br><br>And because his patrons mark an eclipse with alms-giving, prayers and bathing, he rarely misses the chance to meet them on this day as well.<br><br>"It's a family tradition and I follow it," says 34-year-old Jaggi. He will fill the beggar's small steel pail with mustard oil and coins and his disheveled sash with lentils.<br><br>For others in the country, the eclipse is not a reason to celebrate, but a more ominous phenomenon. Send us your photos of the eclipse<br><br>Most pregnant women hope to avoid giving birth during an eclipse.<br><br>"None of the expectant mothers under my treatment are willing to have deliveries on Wednesday," Shivani Sachdev Gour, a gynecologist at New Delhi's Fortis La Femme hospital, told CNN.<br><br>In fact, there are critically ill patients who do not want to be in the hospital on the day of the eclipse, she said.<br><br>Indian astrologers even advise expectant mothers to stay indoors when this celestial event occurs.<br><br>"It may not cause any physical harm to the baby, but it may affect the child's overall personality," said R.K. Sharma, who describes himself as a "remedial astrologer."<br><br>A solar eclipse, he says, weakens the sun god temporarily because of an encounter with dragon Rahu and leaves some cascading results everywhere.<br><br>"Bathing in holy rivers and ponds during this time thus helps protect health and develop positivism and greater will power," he explained.<br><br>About 1.5 million people are expected at one such pond -- the Brahmsarovar, or the pool of Hindu god Brahma -- in northern India on Wednesday.<br><br>"They offer prayers to the sun god and take holy dips during an eclipse," said Ashok Kumar Bansal, the sub-divisional magistrate of Kurukshetra, an ancient Hindu city.<br><br>But the century's longest total solar eclipse is not just about the dragon-sun combat, it also means business for some.<br><br>Travel firms in India have plans in place to cash in on the phenomenon.<br><br>Cox and Kings India has a planeload of eclipse watchers heading for the eastern state of Bihar, one of the most preferred locations for sighting the event.<br><br>The plane will hover over Gaya in Bihar and return to New Delhi the same day, company spokesman Thomas C. Thottathil told CNN.<br><br>Passengers were given two options: to book a "sunside" seat facing the eclipse for about $1,640, or reserve an "earthside" seat for about $610, Thottathil added.<br><br>"And it's a sold out flight now!" he said.
