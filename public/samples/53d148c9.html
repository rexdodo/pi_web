I hadn't talked to her in a while. She said, "I'm going to be all right, Candy. Everything is going to be all right."<br><br>King: Why do you think, Candy, she did the documentary?<br><br>Spelling: I think that she wanted to give other people courage that, you know, are fighting this kind of thing. I know how, you know, devastating the press, you know, was with Aaron when he had cancer. And it's just so difficult. And I mean, you know, it's hard to have a private life at that point.<br><br>King: Why do the tabloids get so tough on someone in such pain?<br><br>Spelling: It's news. It's kind of a sad thing. I'm always so sorry to see it. But, you know, people believe what they see, and a lot of times, we don't know how true it really is.</div>
