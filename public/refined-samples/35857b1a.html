Some 35,000 people had fled to evacuation centers, the official Philippines News Agency reported, citing the Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council.<br><br>The worst-hit areas included Bayambang, Alcala and Basista, the news agency reported.<br><br>People clambered onto rooftops as floodwaters rose, calling and texting for help.
