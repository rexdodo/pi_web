    (EW.com) -- There's no denying the power of the romantic comedy, even if "Valentine's Day," the movie, is as manufactured as the holiday itself.<br><br>The all-star film grossed an estimated $52.4 million over three days and is likely to top $60 million by the time the Presidents Day holiday weekend is over. Its high-grossing debut -- the best ever for Presidents Day -- coupled with solid numbers from the other two new wide releases put 2010's holiday frame into the record books with an estimated total gross of $193 million.<br><br>"Percy Jackson & The Olympians," based on the popular kids' book series by author Rick Riordan, earned an estimated $31.1 million for the three days while the R-rated horror remake "Wolfman," starring Benicio del Toro, grossed an estimated $30.6 million for a per-theater average of $9,497.<br><br>"Avatar," in its ninth weekend of release, grossed another $22 million, falling only 4 percent from its previous weekend and putting its total cume close to $660 million.<br><br>Last weekend's winner, "Dear John," dropped into fifth place for the frame. Losing 50 percent of its value, primarily off of "Valentine's Day" competition, the film earned $15.3 million. Its total stands at $53 million.<br><br>These strong numbers from female-driven films have Hollywood noticing that women are strong drivers of box office. Expect a rash of female-starring films to be green lit in the near future as the industry realizes (yet again) that women love going to the movies.
