    (CNN)  -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson hailed his side's rollercoaster 4-3 victory over neighbors Manchester City at Old Trafford as the "best derby of all time."<br><br>Ferguson and substitute Gary Neville celebrate Owen's late winner.<br><br>Ferguson made the claim while ruing his side's sloppy defensive play which allowed City to claim three equalizing goals before Michael Owen's clinical winner deep into injury time on Sunday.<br><br>"It could have been an embarrassment, 6-0 or 7-0, if we defended our proper way," claimed the legendary Scot.<br><br>"We could have won by a big score but by making mistakes, which was the essence of the game, we probably were in the best derby game of all time.<br><br>"What do you choose? Win the best derby game of all time or win 6-0? I'd probably pick 6-0." Was this the greatest derby ever?<br><br>The build-up to the match had been marked by a war of words between Ferguson and City manager Mark Hughes, who has been handed a massive transfer budget by his side's Abu Dhabi owners.<br><br>Ferguson had branded them "cocky" and did little to dampen down the rivalry with his post match comments.<br><br>Blog:Should referees also keep time?<br><br>"Sometimes you have a noisy neighbor. You cannot do anything about that. They will always be noisy," he said.<br><br>"You just have to get on with your life, put your television on and turn it up a bit louder.<br><br>"Today the players showed their form. That is the best answer of all."<br><br>By contrast, City manager Mark Hughes was furious with referee Martin Atkinson for the amount of added time played, with Owen scoring in the 96th minute.<br><br>"We need an explanation because I don't know why the referee has added that amount of time on," said Hughes.<br><br>"We just feel a little bit aggrieved that they were given that time."<br><br>It was a heartbreaking finale for his team with Bellamy's magnificent second goal after a mistake by Rio Ferdinand appearing to give his up and coming side a share of the spoils.<br><br>"We're disappointed, we put in a hell of a shift today," said Hughes. "Craig Bellamy scored two magnificent goals. He didn't deserve to be on the losing side," added Hughes.<br><br>Ferguson, who has used free transfer signing Owen sparingly this season, said the England striker showed his true quality.<br><br>"His positional play, first touch and finish were absolutely superb. World class."<br><br>The victory took United to second place in the English Premier League behind pacesetting Chelsea with City suffering their first defeat of the season.
